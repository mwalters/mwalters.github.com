	<div class="post-content"><p>The year is coming to an end, and friends and family keep sending me letters saying what's been up with them this year.  Just tonight I received an email from a friend and they said they had opted to go electronic this year for their letter.  That sounded like a pretty good idea.  I've never written one of these, but I figure my blog is a good platform for it, however I will ask that you bear with me since it's my first time with one of these :)</p>

<p>The beginning of the year was somewhat turbulent for me.  It was riddled with sickness and general unpleasantness.  It all started with <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/01/24/wisdom-teeth-are-out-and-i-kinda-regret-it/">having my wisdom teeth removed</a>.  Unfortunately something went wrong in the procedure, and the result was the front portion of my lower jaw/lip was left numb.  Luckily feeling slowly started returning to it, and now there's only a very small part that isn't 100%.  I'm starting to think that's permanent, but at least it's not annoying.  Within a week after that, I came down with a cold, and then shortly after that, the flu, or something equally bad.  Needless to say, January/February pretty much sucked.</p>

<p>I wish I could say that was the end of the bad news.  Shortly after that, I ended up finding myself on the way to Mississippi because my Grandfather passed away.  Then, my employer at the time, started having lay-off's.  Unfortunately some people I had grown pretty close to found themselves without a job.</p>

<p>Luckily, things started turning around about mid-year.  I moved into a townhouse (more space!).  Most (all?) of my friends seem to be doing great on the job-front (never doubted that they'd turn out any different) and I've managed to stay fairly close with most of them.  Also, in July, I accepted a position with a new company (Business Bullpen), still doing Web Development.  So far it's been pretty fun.  I'm getting to work on some pretty mind-blowing high profile websites, and I got to move towards developing more heavily with WordPress on some other sites.  Graham and Todd are fun to work with, and I'd probably say I feel more "at home" with this job then any other I've ever had.  That's not just because I get to work from home a lot either ;)</p>

<p>Towards the end of this year I've found myself commuting to Charlottesville twice a week, and probably getting too addicted to TV shows -- True Blood, Entourage, Heroes, House, The Office, 30 Rock, Stargate Atlantis (which is letting me down for its series finale), and some others here and there.</p>

<p>So even though 2008 started off more rocky then I would have liked, at least it finally picked up and things look good for 2009 (knock on wood).  I hope to continue with my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/tag/pic-of-the-day/">Picture of the Day Series</a>, try to get better at staying connected with friends, and keep moving forward.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Over the past weeks/months I've become more interested in making sure my systems are properly backed up.  Recently <a href="/2008/12/13/home-work-space/?phpMyAdmin=544c4b4bff4ct2249f7e0#comment-100173">I mentioned</a> I wanted to detail my setup in a post.  It's been awhile since I've suffered a significant hardware failure (knock on wood) so part of me thinks I'm "due" for one.  Here is my basic process and my current setup:</p>

<p>Setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>2008 MacBook (Main System) - 320GB internal drive</li>
<li>First Gen black MacBook (Media Center / File Server) 80GB internal drive</li>
<li>3x250GB external HDD</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220246">2GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220247">4GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220301">8GB</a> thumb drives (these particular ones are <em>tiny</em>)</li>
<li>Account with <a href="http://www.bingodisk.com/">BingoDisk</a> (100GB Plan)</li>
<li>Amazon S3 Account</li>
<li>MobileMe Account</li>
</ul>

<p>Process:
<ol>
* My main system has a TimeMachine (250GB external USB) drive connected to it almost constantly.  It's certainly connected when I'm working, and is usually only not connected when I retire to the sofa to watch TV or go to a friends house and am just goofing off on it.  I travel with the external drive.
* Periodically (I try to do this at least once per week) I use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> to clone my main system to a second drive (250GB external USB) which is also carried with me when I travel.
* Less periodically then in Step 2 I do a SuperDuper! clone to the third drive (250GB external USB).  This so that if my typical HDD clone is for some reason bad, I can step further back in time in hopes that it will be ok.  This drive does not travel with me.
* OSX Install Disk has been cloned to a 8GB thumb drive and travels with me.
* I haven't received it yet, but I ordered <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">Disk Warrior 4</a> which I also plan to clone to a thumb drive, and it will travel with me.
* My main system has a copy of the music from my iTunes library and some random videos.  I typically purchase new content on my main system and download to it.  Weekly I perform an rsync backup of my iTunes library from my main system to my first gen MacBook iTunes library.
* My first gen MacBook weekly (or whenever I add a substantial amount of content to it) performs an rsync of its iTunes library to Bingodisk.  Its iTunes library has my full collection -- music, TV shows, movies, etc.
* S3 is used sparsely.  I know it's supposed to be supremely reliable, but I have lots of issues with it timing out when copying large amounts of data to it.
* MobileMe account is used to store things like online receipts and various documents I like to keep handy.
</ol>
All things considered, I view this as a fairly comprehensive backup strategy, and it is fairly easy to maintain.  For instance, to rsync from my main system to my first gen MacBook, I quickly mount the volume on my main system and then run this shell script:
<pre>rsync -a -u -v -F --exclude="<em>DS_Store</em>" /Users/username/music/itunes/"iTunes Music"/ /Volumes/Media/iTunes/</pre>
Then the script is very similar to rsync from my first gen MacBook to Bingodisk.  It also keeps it from transferring annoying DS_Store files on Mac systems.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/Products/drobo.html">Drobo system</a> in the near future to connect to my first gen MacBook and use it for most of my file serving needs and further simplify my backup process.</p>

<p>Anyone see something I'm missing or have any further tips to give me a better safety net?</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>One thing I forgot to mention in <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/08/29/the-interview-part-1/">Part 1 of The Interview</a> was that the question doesn't need to be reserved for technical oriented interviews.  Playing with the wording a little bit, allows the question to be suited to just about any type of position.  I used this same question technique when I was asked to cross-interview designers for instance.  I could see it easily being applied to project managers and many other job types.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>So for those that don't <em>really</em> know me, I tend to be a bit of an introvert (ok, ok, for those that <em>really</em> know me, a lot of an introvert), and can have some pretty geeky tendencies at times.  But I think the subject matter of this post could be useful to both introverts and extroverts, geeks and non-geeks.</p>

<p>It all centers around this basic question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about an experience you've had that excited you.  What 
  were some of the obstacles you encountered during that experience, 
  and how did you overcome them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before taking my new position, I was the Web Development Manager for an advertising agency.  One of my responsibilities was interviewing potential developers to get a feel for their skills, and how well they would fit in with the current team.</p>

<p>I think a lot of geeks totally miss that second part.  To them (and me until I had a realization of my own), my social skills shouldn't really matter.  After all, what should really matter is how well I can do the tasks I'll be assigned, and as a coder (from a geeks perspective), my social skills shouldn't really be a variable in the equation.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), that's not the case.  You need to be able to get along with your potential teammates and not cause turmoil in the process.  Your manager doesn't want to have to deal with that, and doesn't want to risk upsetting the team balance.</p>

<p>Now, back to The question.  Many times other managers or co-workers asked me what types of questions I asked.  I also worked with recruiters, and they'd often ask what type of questions I'd be giving their applicants.  Both groups of people often laughed at my answer.</p>

<p>Here's the deal, I've interviewed a decent number of people, and I only ever had The question prepared.  I'd phrase it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.  
  What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while 
  building the project, and how did you overcome them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The great thing about this question is that it starts a true conversation.  Based on how the applicant answered, I almost immediately knew whether I was interested in hiring them or not.  Let's look at why the question is successful.  The question has 3 basic parts.</p>

<p><strong>1) Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.</strong></p>

<p>What I really want is to see the candidate get excited.  This part of the question gives them every reason and every chance to do so.  I wanted to see that "burning desire" for what they do for a living to come out and show itself.</p>

<p><strong>2) What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while building the project?</strong></p>

<p>This is potentially a nicer way to ask, "what are some of your weaknesses."  However it is a little open ended in that regard.  The difficulties they encountered might not be due to a weakness at all, but just a problem that was genuinely difficult to solve.  Either way, the answer they give you is worthy of hearing.  It also potentially gives you the opportunity to discuss some of your personal experience, and how your team operates.</p>

<p><strong>3) How did you overcome them?</strong></p>

<p>This is the real meat and potatoes of most interviews anyhow.  Remember in math class how your teacher would some times give you partial credit if you showed your work but made a mistake somewhere along the way?  I think this question is somewhat like that.  I wanted to see how you thought through problems, how your brain works.  Whether I would have solved it the same way does not matter at all.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think the managers, coworkers, recruiters chuckled at me because all they really heard me say was, "I only come prepared with one question to an interview."  I would say back to them, "but look at the question I ask."  Usually once they'd thought it over, it made a lot more sense to them.  Some were always skeptical though.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though, I had some real varied responses to the question in interviews.  Everything from "well, I guess my personal site because it has some flash and that was tough" to 30-45 minute responses that resembled dissertations almost.  The latter was closer to what I was looking for.  The former shows absolutely no burning desire for the work, and little regard for my time to be quite honest.  But again, I'd argue that's one of the best things about The question.  If they give me the short quip, I know almost instantly that they're not a person I'm interested in hiring.  The ones that engage me in conversation, I'll know enough about to make an informed decision on whether they have the technical aptitude to fulfill the positions requirements and whether they'll fit in socially with the team.  That's the whole point of an interview, isn't it?</p>

<p>Even when I'm interviewing for positions, I try to give myself the opportunity to answer this question.  It's pretty easy to work in.  Just wait for the interviewer to ask you a fairly open-ended question (which they pretty much always do), and then answer them by answering this question.  It has a couple benefits for you as well.  You get to show them excitement, you get to show off something cool you did instead of just listing technical skills (boring!).  It also gives you a chance to engage them in a conversation, instead of worrying about what question is coming next.  It takes away some of that innate nervousness that comes with being interviewed.  That's a major plus if you're an introvert like me.</p></div>
