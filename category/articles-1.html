	<div class="post-meta">
		Posted <a href="/2009/03/03/webhosting-advice.html
">March 3rd, 2009</a>
		 in <a href="/category/articles-0.html">Articles</a>	</div>
	<div class="post-content"><p>Webhosting is something I am frequently asked about.  I've had a site hosted in some fashion since the late 90's, so dealing with the in's and out's of hosting is something I've become quite familiar with.  These days I've even moved towards configuring my own servers to host my sites.  But this article isn't going to get into that side of things.</p>

<p>I decided it was time that I finally chronicle what I've learned over the years and what my current setup is along with the reasons I like it how it is.  To the average user, my setup might seem complex, but even if you only put a couple of these practices to work, I think you'll find yourself well on the way to having a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>I practice a fairly modular setup for my array of websites and it has its benefits.  By splitting things up I can get the most bang for the buck by putting critical systems on providers that provide mission critical support, and other things on more inexpensive solutions (yes, even in hosting you largely get what you pay for).</p>

<p>Moving on to my recommended setup:</p>

<p><strong>Registering your domain</strong>
This is the first step in setting up a website for yourself.  I highly recommend <a href="http://enom.com/">eNom.com</a> as a registrar.  I've been using them for nearly 5 years now and they're a pretty solid registrar.  Even if you have already registered your domain somewhere else, I'd recommend considering a transfer of your domain to eNom.</p>

<p>The main reason I like eNom as a registrar is the free DNS hosting, which is crucial to my setup.  However, in general they're a good registrar.  Their prices are competitive, managing your domain is easy with their web interface, and they aren't always trying to push additional services on you.  Don't get me wrong, additional services are there but they don't shove them on you.</p>

<p>Allowing them to host my DNS is the linchpin of my setup.  Many webhosts ask you to set the DNS servers for your domain to theirs.  Unfortunately changing nameservers is still a drawn out process, sometimes taking up to 24-48 hours to complete.  Compounding the issue, many times you can't setup the DNS records on your new nameservers until the domain servers have changed.  This can mean even more hours, potentially of downtime, for your site.  Since my DNS is with eNom, if I change webhosts or email providers, I can just update the zonefile for my domain and usually within an hour or two everything has changed over.</p>

<p>If you REALLY like your current registrar, then you can look into other third party DNS hosting services that will still allow you the benefits I'll be describing below.  I just happen to prefer eNom.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing an email provider</strong>
Many folks will choose to host their email with their current webhost.  That's fine, but I'd argue there are other solutions, better solutions, available to you.  The one I use is GMail.  Google's interface for GMail is pretty top notch and the fact that you can get <a href="http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new">Google Apps</a> for your domain for free, why not choose them?  Their downtime is extremely low, and you can use the web interface when you're not around your computer.  If you do like the feel of a desktop client though, you can still access your email via IMAP or POP3.</p>

<p>Google Apps is also a scalable solution.  You can start off on the free version and add up to 50 users on your domain.  If you outgrow 50 users, or you start running into storage concerns with your archived email you can always convert to the paid version at $50 per year per user.  That's really not that bad of an option unless you have a spare exchange server sitting around (but really, if you have that kind of infrastructure already in place why aren't you just hosting your own website?).</p>

<p>Also, by sourcing your email to a third party like this you also ease transitioning between webhosts should you ever need to.  Since your DNS is hosted by a central party, you never have to change your MX records (the DNS settings that tell your email where to go) when you change your website from one host to another.  This means no concerns over some email getting left on your old host, or losing emails in the transition, etc.</p>

<p>See how hosting your DNS on your own is starting to fit together in the plan?</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a webhost</strong>
This is probably where 90% of my friends that have problems make their mistake.  Webhosting is a low margin business.  They make their money by hosting as many people on as few servers as possible.  The sheer number of competitors in the industry make it almost problematic.  You have everyone from high school (maybe even middle school these days) kids that buy a reseller account with a webhost and then offer plans at $1.99/mo, promising 99.999% uptime and unlimited disk space/bandwidth.  Then on the other end of the spectrum, there are folks offering webhosting for $50/mo and you don't necessarily get $50 of service per month.</p>

<p>Let me be clear, you do not want to host with someone promising unlimited services and extremely high uptime guarantees.  If they're an industry giant, like Yahoo perhaps, you will probably be fine but there will usually be catches involved in the plan.  There are a couple things you should be aware of though between the those two possible scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Scenario 1 - The fly by nighter</em>
In this case, you're definitely in trouble.  They'll soon get bored, or start wondering why they aren't making any money and chances are they'll just shut the server down, leaving you without access to your website (possibly email), etc.  It could take you days to recover.  The whole time your website is down.  Don't even get me started on how these folks tend to like advertising 99.999% uptime.  They often have trouble achieving 80% uptime.</p>

<p><em>Scenario 2 - The industry giant</em>
You're in a slightly better situation here, but keep in mind these companies are in it to make money.  Usually the small print of those agreements you're making during sign up include text saying that if you start to use too much disk space, bandwidth, or processor time, they have the right to shut your site down.  They'll put up all kinds of walls to keep you from actually storing terabytes of data on their servers.  They can't make money on you if they do allow it.  If you plan on using reasonable resources though, you're probably fine, but an industry giant selling unlimited disk space, etc, likely isn't going to do that for $1.99/mo.</p>

<p>So if your website is even the least bit important to you, I recommend you plan on spending around $10-$20 per month on your hosting.  You can find some rock solid providers in that price range and it's really not that expensive.</p>

<p>As for my personal hosting plans, I currently have plans with two separate providers, but that's not something the average user is going to need.</p>

<p>My primary hosting plan is a (dv) server with <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a>.  It hosts mattwalters.net and <a href="http://snipit.me/">SnipIt.me</a> along with some other small sites I have setup mainly for testing purposes.</p>

<p>My other hosting plan is with <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">slicehost</a>.  This plan is where <a href="http://WordPressEasily.com/">WordPressEasily.com</a> and its hosted blogs reside.  WordPress Easily is quite the complicated setup though.  The nature of the service dictates needing to be able to bring new servers online quickly or swap out servers, etc.</p>

<p>Just to finish tying in the modular concept, by having all 3 of these services sourced to different providers, it leaves me in an agile position.  If I need to move to a different webhost for some reason, I can easily change the DNS records for my domain and have my site moved over quickly.  Or if I need to point a subdomain to a different server for whatever reason, it's a quick change.  Same goes for email, if I wanted to change to a different provider, I could do so without affecting my websites.  Really, the only catch to this setup is I can't easily change registrars ;)</p>

<p>Hope you've found this informative and maybe even taken away something good from it.  If you have any tips you'd like to share, by all means feel free to do so in the comments :)</p></div>

">January 16th, 2009</a>
		 in <a href="/category/articles-0.html">Articles</a>	</div>
	<div class="post-content"><p>Last month I was a bit startled to receive an electricity bill that was a little over double what it had been.  Obviously the key factor at play here was the dip in temperatures.  But it still seemed wild that it more then doubled to me.  I decided to do a bit of an experiment to see if I could a) keep it from rising again since it was getting colder, and b) potentially reduce the amount.</p>

<p><strong>Changes I Made</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I took note of my thermostat.  I had talked to the power company and they gave me a basic statistic that for every degree over 68 degree's that you set your thermostat during this time of year, your heater has to work 3 percent harder to keep up.  I have nothing other then them telling me this to back it up, but even if the percentage is off, the concept is logical.  I had my thermostat set to roughly 69/70 degree's.  I reduced it to more in the 66/67 degree range (it's not digital, so I can only be so precise).</p>

<p>I took stock of all my "phantom power" devices.  I had heard that CRT TV's for instance can use almost as much power in the OFF position as they do when they are turned on, and that Plasma TV's weren't much better.  I have a 50" plasma TV and a 30'ish inch CRT TV.  At my Plasma TV I also have a sound system, DVD/Bluray Player, AppleTV, Wii, Cable Box/DVR, and a media center MacBook.  At my CRT TV I have a cable box, DVD player and the TV itself.  Then there's my home office / workstation which has my power adapter for my primary MacBook, speakers, 21'ish inch LCD monitor, powered USB hub, printer, etc.</p>

<p>That is a LOT of devices to try to unplug to reduce phantom power drain.  So I went to Target and purchased several inexpensive power strips.  My workstation uses two of them due to the sheer number of devices.  My Plasma TV area uses one, and my CRT TV uses one.  I wanted to have as little impact on my daily life while still reducing my energy consumption.  So since my HD DVR is at the Plasma area, I put everything except the DVR onto the power strip.  This way the DVR can still record programs even though all the other devices are completely turned off when I flip the power strip.</p>

<p>The other change I made, and this is the part that takes a little discipline is I started forcing myself to turn the power strips off when I wasn't going to be actively using one of the areas.  So if I'm not in my living room watching the Plasma, it's power strip is off.  Same with the other two stations.  When I go to bed, I turn on the power strip for the CRT, watch TV and eventually fall asleep, then before I leave my bedroom in the morning, I make sure to flip it off.  It isn't hard, and it's completely become habit now.</p>

<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>

<p>Well, I didn't really know what to expect.  Also, since you don't receive a power bill until you're already partially into your next billing cycle, I haven't been able to test this concept for a full month.  However, the temperatures have been dropping in general still.  But so far the end result is my electric bill went down a little over $25.  I think that is worthwhile personally.  I'll definitely be interested in seeing what the next bill tells me.</p>

<p><strong>Of Note</strong></p>

<p>I got this concept from a DIY TV Show once that was focused on being Eco Friendly.  There is a product out there called a <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/green-switch-for-green-savings">Green Switch</a>.  Basically by changing some of your wiring a little, you can use this one switch to power down various devices across your entire house.  I lease a town house so a modification like this doesn't work in my scenario.  However, I was able to accomplish almost the same thing with my use of inexpensive power strips.  I thought it was worth mentioning here for any homeowners that might be interested in the Green Switch however.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/3167834193/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/3167834193_6d6a05c111_t.jpg" align="right" /></a>Not connected to my power consumption, but worth noting while I'm talking about being Green is another simple change I've made.  I've purchased several inexpensive wash towels (and my mom even crocheted me a few) that I now use almost exclusively in place of paper towels.  I probably have invested less then $10 in my purchase of these and now go through maybe one roll of paper towels every 1.5-2 months.  I just use them and wash them as I do my regular laundry.  If you have enough, you'll always have some clean ones available, and they're cheap as anything, not to mention way more absorbent then any paper towel on the market.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Over the past weeks/months I've become more interested in making sure my systems are properly backed up.  Recently <a href="/2008/12/13/home-work-space/?phpMyAdmin=544c4b4bff4ct2249f7e0#comment-100173">I mentioned</a> I wanted to detail my setup in a post.  It's been awhile since I've suffered a significant hardware failure (knock on wood) so part of me thinks I'm "due" for one.  Here is my basic process and my current setup:</p>

<p>Setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>2008 MacBook (Main System) - 320GB internal drive</li>
<li>First Gen black MacBook (Media Center / File Server) 80GB internal drive</li>
<li>3x250GB external HDD</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220246">2GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220247">4GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220301">8GB</a> thumb drives (these particular ones are <em>tiny</em>)</li>
<li>Account with <a href="http://www.bingodisk.com/">BingoDisk</a> (100GB Plan)</li>
<li>Amazon S3 Account</li>
<li>MobileMe Account</li>
</ul>

<p>Process:
<ol>
* My main system has a TimeMachine (250GB external USB) drive connected to it almost constantly.  It's certainly connected when I'm working, and is usually only not connected when I retire to the sofa to watch TV or go to a friends house and am just goofing off on it.  I travel with the external drive.
* Periodically (I try to do this at least once per week) I use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> to clone my main system to a second drive (250GB external USB) which is also carried with me when I travel.
* Less periodically then in Step 2 I do a SuperDuper! clone to the third drive (250GB external USB).  This so that if my typical HDD clone is for some reason bad, I can step further back in time in hopes that it will be ok.  This drive does not travel with me.
* OSX Install Disk has been cloned to a 8GB thumb drive and travels with me.
* I haven't received it yet, but I ordered <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">Disk Warrior 4</a> which I also plan to clone to a thumb drive, and it will travel with me.
* My main system has a copy of the music from my iTunes library and some random videos.  I typically purchase new content on my main system and download to it.  Weekly I perform an rsync backup of my iTunes library from my main system to my first gen MacBook iTunes library.
* My first gen MacBook weekly (or whenever I add a substantial amount of content to it) performs an rsync of its iTunes library to Bingodisk.  Its iTunes library has my full collection -- music, TV shows, movies, etc.
* S3 is used sparsely.  I know it's supposed to be supremely reliable, but I have lots of issues with it timing out when copying large amounts of data to it.
* MobileMe account is used to store things like online receipts and various documents I like to keep handy.
</ol>
All things considered, I view this as a fairly comprehensive backup strategy, and it is fairly easy to maintain.  For instance, to rsync from my main system to my first gen MacBook, I quickly mount the volume on my main system and then run this shell script:
<pre>rsync -a -u -v -F --exclude="<em>DS_Store</em>" /Users/username/music/itunes/"iTunes Music"/ /Volumes/Media/iTunes/</pre>
Then the script is very similar to rsync from my first gen MacBook to Bingodisk.  It also keeps it from transferring annoying DS_Store files on Mac systems.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/Products/drobo.html">Drobo system</a> in the near future to connect to my first gen MacBook and use it for most of my file serving needs and further simplify my backup process.</p>

<p>Anyone see something I'm missing or have any further tips to give me a better safety net?</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>So for those that don't <em>really</em> know me, I tend to be a bit of an introvert (ok, ok, for those that <em>really</em> know me, a lot of an introvert), and can have some pretty geeky tendencies at times.  But I think the subject matter of this post could be useful to both introverts and extroverts, geeks and non-geeks.</p>

<p>It all centers around this basic question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about an experience you've had that excited you.  What 
  were some of the obstacles you encountered during that experience, 
  and how did you overcome them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before taking my new position, I was the Web Development Manager for an advertising agency.  One of my responsibilities was interviewing potential developers to get a feel for their skills, and how well they would fit in with the current team.</p>

<p>I think a lot of geeks totally miss that second part.  To them (and me until I had a realization of my own), my social skills shouldn't really matter.  After all, what should really matter is how well I can do the tasks I'll be assigned, and as a coder (from a geeks perspective), my social skills shouldn't really be a variable in the equation.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), that's not the case.  You need to be able to get along with your potential teammates and not cause turmoil in the process.  Your manager doesn't want to have to deal with that, and doesn't want to risk upsetting the team balance.</p>

<p>Now, back to The question.  Many times other managers or co-workers asked me what types of questions I asked.  I also worked with recruiters, and they'd often ask what type of questions I'd be giving their applicants.  Both groups of people often laughed at my answer.</p>

<p>Here's the deal, I've interviewed a decent number of people, and I only ever had The question prepared.  I'd phrase it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.  
  What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while 
  building the project, and how did you overcome them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The great thing about this question is that it starts a true conversation.  Based on how the applicant answered, I almost immediately knew whether I was interested in hiring them or not.  Let's look at why the question is successful.  The question has 3 basic parts.</p>

<p><strong>1) Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.</strong></p>

<p>What I really want is to see the candidate get excited.  This part of the question gives them every reason and every chance to do so.  I wanted to see that "burning desire" for what they do for a living to come out and show itself.</p>

<p><strong>2) What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while building the project?</strong></p>

<p>This is potentially a nicer way to ask, "what are some of your weaknesses."  However it is a little open ended in that regard.  The difficulties they encountered might not be due to a weakness at all, but just a problem that was genuinely difficult to solve.  Either way, the answer they give you is worthy of hearing.  It also potentially gives you the opportunity to discuss some of your personal experience, and how your team operates.</p>

<p><strong>3) How did you overcome them?</strong></p>

<p>This is the real meat and potatoes of most interviews anyhow.  Remember in math class how your teacher would some times give you partial credit if you showed your work but made a mistake somewhere along the way?  I think this question is somewhat like that.  I wanted to see how you thought through problems, how your brain works.  Whether I would have solved it the same way does not matter at all.</p>

<p>I think the managers, coworkers, recruiters chuckled at me because all they really heard me say was, "I only come prepared with one question to an interview."  I would say back to them, "but look at the question I ask."  Usually once they'd thought it over, it made a lot more sense to them.  Some were always skeptical though.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though, I had some real varied responses to the question in interviews.  Everything from "well, I guess my personal site because it has some flash and that was tough" to 30-45 minute responses that resembled dissertations almost.  The latter was closer to what I was looking for.  The former shows absolutely no burning desire for the work, and little regard for my time to be quite honest.  But again, I'd argue that's one of the best things about The question.  If they give me the short quip, I know almost instantly that they're not a person I'm interested in hiring.  The ones that engage me in conversation, I'll know enough about to make an informed decision on whether they have the technical aptitude to fulfill the positions requirements and whether they'll fit in socially with the team.  That's the whole point of an interview, isn't it?</p>

<p>Even when I'm interviewing for positions, I try to give myself the opportunity to answer this question.  It's pretty easy to work in.  Just wait for the interviewer to ask you a fairly open-ended question (which they pretty much always do), and then answer them by answering this question.  It has a couple benefits for you as well.  You get to show them excitement, you get to show off something cool you did instead of just listing technical skills (boring!).  It also gives you a chance to engage them in a conversation, instead of worrying about what question is coming next.  It takes away some of that innate nervousness that comes with being interviewed.  That's a major plus if you're an introvert like me.</p></div>
