<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I don't understand why companies think they should be allowed to ETF my checking acct when they won't let me do the same to theirs</p>&mdash; Matt Walters (@mwalters) <a href="https://twitter.com/mwalters/status/177773804632813568" data-datetime="2012-03-08T15:12:32+00:00">March 8, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I think it's pretty obvious why a company would want this from their perspective.  Many Americans keep their mortgage payment, car payment, etc… in their checking account.  It's sort of the purpose for the account after all and they know the consumer will try to keep the account padded.  So companies want access because they know it's one of their best chances at getting cash from you reliably.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120308-kbh9ibyh7ambhfbse1qs7kir9x.jpg" align="left" alt="Cash Wallet" style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" />I say giving a company access to auto-draft your checking account is tantamount to opening your wallet toward them and saying, "here, take what you need."  </p>

<p>The very reasons that companies want this sort of unfettered access to your money are the same exact reasons that you should be protecting it like it's your own personal Fort Knox.</p>

<p>What if the company has a billing error?  Who hasn't experienced that before?  With access to your checking account it could leave you strapped to pay other bills.  By the time you deal with their over-sea's billing department or whatever absurd processes they have in place, it could take a long period of time to get things straightened out.</p>

<p>I'm not saying all automatic recurring payments are bad.  But if you want to bill me like that, have a credit card payment as an option.  I understand it means you have to pay processing fees, but honestly, I don't care.</p>

<p>At least then the consumer has a buffer between their checking account and the company.  As a consumer it's good too because your credit card company should be someone you can at least reason with if you have a record of being responsible with them, and they might even go to bat with the other company if you need them to and you can prove that it was an error on the part of the billing party.  Worst case, you have the option to pay off the credit card over time and not have it impact your personal cash flow as seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a somewhat cautionary tail</strong></p>

<p>Once I had a DSL provider (Verizon) charge me for 2 months service when connecting me.  This wasn't standard.  It was an <strong>admitted</strong> error on the part of their billing department.  Straigtening it out involved me having to talk to someone in another country, and the best they could offer me was putting it as a credit toward my future service.  They absolutely refused to reverse all or part of the transaction to put my cash back in my account and there was nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>Luckily this was just a low dollar DSL service payment.  But what if it was something larger?  Or what if they'd billed me for a years worth of service?  Mistakes happen at large companies, and leaving the consumer holding the bag over a company error is horrible.</p>

<p>This happened years ago.  But I learned my lesson and I urge you to learn from it too.  Outside of extraordinary circumstances, stop letting companies have such easy access to your cash.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>I have had programming language debates in the past.  I've recently been having similar discussions and realized some things.  Arguing one language against another is a religious debate that will never be won.  I realized it wasn't about #winning.  It would be more valuable to change the discussion to why I chose PHP and continue developing with it to this day.<!--more--></p>

<p>Total disclosure, one of the key reasons I chose PHP originally was because it was easy to find an inexpensive web host that supported it.  In fact the web host I was using at the time already supported it.  I didn't have to worry about licensing fee's, there were many hosts supporting it, and I was already using web applications built on it.  Those are pretty simple reasons, and certainly reasons that could have changed over time.  For instance, unlike when I was 20 and learning PHP, these days I could afford the licensing fee's if I chose to.  The key thing that has kept me with PHP is the documentation and community.</p>

<p>The documentation for PHP itself is unrivaled with other languages from what I've seen.  PHP.net is a fantastic learning resource and was a huge help when I was getting started.  I could easily browse available functions, and didn't need to search across tons of blogs for likely out of date information.  If I needed to sort an array I could look up sort() and as well as providing me the syntax/parameters, at the bottom of the page it would list other array sorting functions which I could check to see if they better met my needs based on what I was doing in my application.  This matured documentation also exists in other places within PHP.  For example in WordPress, the documentation is fairly strong.  It's not always completely up to date, but the fact it's as comprehensive as it is places it head and shoulders above many other open source programs.</p>

<p>The community is definitely the key feature for me with PHP.  I find it both welcoming and accepting of various skill levels.  I find folks in the PHP community commonly focus on getting stuff done and eagerly teach and share with each other.  There's not much meaningless focus on academic debates or pontificating to boost one's own ego.  That's not to say those things never happens in the PHP community, but I find it happening less often in the world of PHP.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why lots of folks like to consider PHP the red-headed stepchild of web development, but they do.  When developers of other languages do start attacking PHP or my use of it, they're usually just reminding me of why I like my choice of PHP in the first place.  It would probably be a more meaningful discussion for all of us if they'd instead try to show me why they chose their preferred language instead of trying to compare it feature for feature with PHP and simply answering my questions while respectfully understanding if I don't agree about whether I should be using their preferred language.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p><img src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/cloud-heart.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>After last weeks Amazon Web Services (AWS) issues, everyone is talking a lot about "The Cloud" and whether it's the right answer for many companies.  I'm a pretty big fan of virtual servers, but I can't say that they are for everyone.  When designing any sort of environment I would say there are some, what should seem simple, ideas to keep in mind:  <!--more--></p>

<h3>Know your uptime requirements:</h3>

<p>Can your business/website withstand being down for 6-12 hours?  I would say most can, probably far more than think they could.  Some organizations over architect their environments because brief amounts of downtime are unpalatable to them when the simple fact is their users will forgive temporary downtime as long as it doesn't become the norm.  Regardless, your organization needs to figure out what your uptime requirements are and architect to those requirements.  If you need extreme amounts of uptime then you need servers/services spread across multiple availability zones if you're with a single provider, and you possibly need to have services in place across multiple providers so you can recover as quickly as possible if something does go wrong.  How far you need to take this will all be determined by your requirements and help you create your Plan B for when things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<h3>Have a Plan B:</h3>

<p>Once you have your uptime requirements in place, you can start formulating a Plan B.  This might include using your load balancer to point at a different availability zone, or it might mean quick DNS changes to point your site to a back-up provider.  Short of that though you need to test failures at a lower level.  What if just one of your UI servers dies, what happens?  Hopefully your application can easily sustain something like this and requests quickly re-route to another server.  Similarly, hopefully the services that your UI servers talk to can easily handle single failures like this.</p>

<h3>Test your Plan B:</h3>

<p><strong>This is important.</strong>  Make sure that things behave how you expect them to.  Shut down one of your UI servers, or your back-end services.  Do things react how you planned?  If not, then fix it so that they do.  What you do not want to have happen is you end up in a situation where your server has failed and brought your site down or your provider starts having cascading failures and you are at the mercy of their email support.  If your plan does all work as planned then great!  Test it periodically and fix things when they come up (you will need to make corrections to your plan as your service grows!), then you can rest easier at night.</p>

<p>At this point you might find yourself wondering about cost, complexity, etc.  I saw a tweet recently that I related to these thoughts:</p>

<p>http://twitter.com/#!/kylecordes/status/61540471767449601</p>

<p>I'm not sure of his exact meaning here but how I interpreted it brings me back to my first point, knowing your requirements.  The cloud is not necessarily inexpensive and is often more complex then having a simpler set up with a dedicated server or two hosted with your favorite provider.  Design for your needs at the time and adapt as they change over time.  You might be just fine hosting in a small environment and keeping good backups that you can restore to another server and/or provider if needed.</p>

<p>You are keeping backups of your data, aren't you?</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Following on the heels of my post of <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2010/08/24/five-must-have-tools/">Five of my must-have tools</a>, I thought I'd share this list of services that might be valuable to others that have started their own at-home business.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4677" title="harvest_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> is a service for tracking time, expenses, and invoicing your clients.  I find it very easy to use and manage due to its straight-forward interface and tools such as the <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/widget">Dashboard Widget</a> and <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/features/iphone">iPhone application</a>help with keeping track of my time.  The emails sent to clients are customizable and the invoices look professional with the option to include your logo.  It also supports partial payment of invoices as well as invoicing services and products.  If that's not enough, you can also define different hourly rates for different people, or different projects, or even different types of tasks.  Plus, you can give log-in credentials to contractors so that they can track their time in your system, making it easier for you to invoice the clients.  If you like PayPal, it even has invoice payment integration with PayPal and automatically marks invoices paid when payment is received via PayPal.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4679" title="googleapps" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg" alt="" width="85" height="83" /></a><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for Domains Standard</a> is a great, free, solution for your e-mail, calendar and document management.  Web mail allows you to use your email from any computer, and IMAP access allows you synchronized read status across your multiple devices (computer, phone, etc assuming all your devices support IMAP).  The calendar program is feature rich and helps you keep on top of scheduled events.  Google Docs is an easy way to create and read simple documents is basically any format.  Though for more complex things you might still find yourself wanting a more robust editor.  The great thing about the Standard edition is that it is free for up to 50 users so you can stick with it if you decide to grow your company, and with things like Sites (Google Apps version of a Wiki) you'll have a place to share documentation for policies/procedures/etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4680" title="icon_ringcentral_bigger" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png" alt="" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/">RingCentral</a> can work quite nicely for your phone needs.  Whether you want to sign up for it and just send calls to your cell phone, or if you want to buy an IP Phone to have a nice desk phone that calls ring into.  I use an IP Phone with my account and have had no problems at all other than my internet connection going down.  But in a previous job we used it and routed calls to our cell phones which worked well too.  You can define different call rules for different hours of the day so that during nights/weekends calls go straight to voicemail, but during normal hours your calls will be routed to your cell or IP phone.  It costs a little money, but can be nice and is another service that can grow with you if you decide to grow your business including features like auto-attendants, "office" extensions (though you don't all need to be in the same place), etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4681" title="rtmdesktop_128x128" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> is a simple task management system with some surprisingly powerful features.  This is a recent re-entry into my work-flow.  I like the ability to create different lists, whether it's a grocery list, or keeping track of follow-up calls/estimates/quotes that I need to send out for work.  They make the data entry as painless as possible and then you can setup things like iCal feeds to have tasks show up on your calendar.  There is also a pretty decent iPhone app available to Pro customers that let you take your to-do list with you to keep up with things.  I also have used this in a previous position and the ability to let team members send you tasks via email that are then added to your to-do list can be nice to have if working with multiple folks.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4682" title="campfire_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> is an online chat room for teams to collaborate and keep up with each other.  Admittedly, this one is a bit of a stretch for a small at-home business but we all need to collaborate with others on projects from time to time and if you're working from home, this might be the perfect solution.  For free, Campfire offers you a chat room with up to 4 simultaneous chatters and up to 10MB of space for uploaded files.  It can be a quick way to chat with multiple folks about a project and share images.  It could even serve as the virtual water cooler if you're working with other folks in different geographic areas or if you just want to invite some friends into it to fight off the lack of social interaction from working at home :)</p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4683" title="fluid_icon2" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://cotweet.com/">CoTweet</a> -- This one is definitely more team focused.  If you have several folks on your team and you're interacting with Twitter then I would consider this to be a must-have for your team.  It allows you to receive email alerts when someone sends a @reply to your twitter account and allows you all to be logged into the same Twitter account at once and see conversations your account has had with users before you respond to them.  If someone else on the team has already responded to someone, you wouldn't want to send a second response from the same account, would you? :)</p>

<p>What would be on your list?  I'm always looking for a better mouse trap.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>In the recent past I've started gathering some pretty useful tools / programs to simplify my life and help me streamline my work flows.  I wanted to share some of them in case others might find them interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4609" title="textexpander_iphone" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png" alt="" width="60" height="58" /></a><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> - This is a recent addition to my toolkit and I am finding it nearly endlessly helpful.  From coding snippets to canned email responses, it is speeding up my work.  I work in a helpdesk situation of sorts and this allows me to quickly piece together emails from verbiage that we commonly use.  On the coding side of things it helps me out by allowing me to not remember the .htaccess syntax for increasing PHP's memory limit, or turning on error reporting and display_errors.  Complex code snippets are saved for a program I'll mention in a moment, but I'm finding uses for TextExpander all over the place.  Also helpful is its ability to sync snippets across Dropbox.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4611" title="TextMate_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png" alt="" width="61" height="61" /></a><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - The Missing Editor for Mac OS X.  That's a fairly accurate description in my opinion.  It is a panacea for nearly all your editing needs.  I use it for coding (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, etc) as well as working with SQL files.  It has features such as Subversion integration via Bundles.  Also available -- <a href="http://github.com/Gipetto/wordpress.tmbundle">WordPress Bundle</a>,  Markdown, and much more via bundles.  Having syntax highlighting available for basically any coding language I could open is extremely helpful, and if you can get accustomed to working with plain text files, something like this will work great for you.  Given the amount of WordPress work I do these days, I love having the WordPress bundle available.  Creating things like Widgets are basically a 5 minute operation for a simple widget now.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4612" title="evernote_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></a><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> - Great tool for working with notes, remembering things, and having easy access across devices (I have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Mac Mini).  This is an easy solution for keeping my notes available to me no matter what device I have handy.  It seems to fit the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS Principle</a>".  Need to make a to-do list?  No problem, create a bulleted list and add a checkbox at the beginning of each line so you can easily track what has been done and what needs doing.  But I can also keep pictures available there if needed, along with notes about them.  It also lets me break my notes up into notebooks so I can more easily separate my work items from my personal items.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4614" title="dropbox_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png" alt="" width="59" height="59" /></a><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - This is a fantastic, yet simple little utility I've grown to love over the past couple of months.  More often, I am switching between my laptop and desktop computers.  Since I typically store many things I might need on my dropbox, I can easily keep working on whatever is at hand.  I have also been using it to share items with friends and coworkers.  I get asked why I used Dropbox from time to time by folks in an effort, I believe, for me to convince them why they should use it.  I usually don't bite on this though.  I think some folks have a use for it (such as folks that have several devices/computers and want an easy way to have files available to all of them) and some folks don't.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4615" title="1PasswordLogo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg" alt="" width="57" height="57" /></a><a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> - If you haven't come across this one yet, you should definitely go check it out and try it.  I have so many passwords these days, it's nearly impossible to keep up with them.  However with 1Password I'm able to use a simple hotkey when sitting at a log in form and it instantly enters the correct username and password for me and submits the form.  It even includes some anti-phishing protection to help prevent you from entering your username and password on a site pretending to be one of your common sites.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many other tools I enjoy using, but these 5 have quickly integrated themselves into how I work and I think if I lost any of them I would be quickly looking for some form of replacement.</p></div>
