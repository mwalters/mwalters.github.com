	<div class="post-content"><p>Jim decided <a href="http://cvreg.org/2007/6/6/my-language-is-better-then-yours-php-edition">to respond</a> to my post regarding <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/05/22/my-language-is-better-then-yours/">language vs. language debates</a>, specifically looking at PHP and Ruby / Ruby on Rails. He makes some good points, but there is some stuff that I'd like to respond to and clarify...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say that one language is better than the other is meaningless. Better 
  in what way? The question should always be asked in a particular context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely agree, in general, I'm just tired of language vs. language debates ... more on that in a moment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t want to talk about the ads, though, because they have 
  their own agenda and it certainly doesn’t match mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Works for me, but keep in mind that most of my original post was working towards making the point that the video's were doing an apples to oranges comparison of PHP (minus framework) to Ruby on Rails.  Jeremy and I disagreed on the validity of this comparison.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, that’s why I am using open-source tools in the first place 
  ...
  For me, the bulk of my language preference comes from language philosophy.
  ...
  but for my tastes, I appreciate the additional power that Ruby 
  metaprogramming allows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some key points that I can agree with, but again, more on that in a moment...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHP =~ COBOL is not an analogy I would make, but at the same time I’d 
  urge you to consider your claim “You’ll always be taking over a Java 
  project or a .NET project or a PHP in light of COBOL, or FORTRAN, or 
  VAX or any other platform that’s been a dominant success in the past. 
  Current popularity is no guarantee of future popularity. In our 
  industry, better mousetraps are ruthlessly adopted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree, as I even said, I can see PHP going by the wayside one day, but today is not that day, and I still believe it's extremely premature to be concerning myself with but so much.  It seemed Jeremy was arguing that Ruby on Rails projects are more easily taken over,  so my counterpoint was simply that RoR, like any other language, is not likely to be so widely adopted that his point would ever really become something you could rely on.  Just to be sure I'm clear, I'm saying that it is unlikely that RoR will become so widespread that you can count on commonly taking over other RoR projects.  This is not me slamming RoR, the same statement could be made in the direction of PHP, .NET, etc.  You'll always be taking over projects built on other platforms.  Even as a PHP developer I experience this commonly.  Just the other day I had to take over a .NET project and we chose to redo it in PHP for various reasons.  I hope that's clear, and if it's not I wish someone would ask the questions I need to answer to make it clear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your focus, like in your last paragraph, is only on user experience 
  (by which I think you mean developer experience), then language preference 
  may truly not matter. But if your focus as a developer is on avoiding 
  future “forced” language changes, then it might make more sense to attempt 
  to determine which new technologies might eventually usurp the old. My 
  claim is that Ruby and Rails are better positioned to do so that PHP
  and its framework set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, finally to the point I kept putting off above.  I actually was not speaking of developer experience.  I was speaking of end-user experience, the folks that visit our websites.  THEIR experience is what matters in the end.  PHP, RoR, .NET, etc are all capable of providing similar, if not identical user experiences.  So if I prefer to provide that user experience with PHP, using mainly procedural based programming, then why not?  If you want to do so with RoR, or any other platform, then more power to you.  As you indicated, there are things about RoR that make you prefer it over PHP.  I see no problem with that.  But to say those ways are better then mine, if achieving a particular user experience is the ultimate measure, is sort of pointless, unless you disagree that the languages are capable of producing similar/identical experiences.</p>

<p>I also want to comment on the fact that it seems in these conversations I keep getting pegged as being resistant to change, not eager to learn new languages, etc.  To be blunt, it's pissing me off.  I've lost count of the languages that at some point I've been well-versed in, let alone the languages I've "dabbled" in.  Just because I'm not actively learning RoR at the moment, does not mean that I think PHP is Gods gift to programming nor does it mean that I am resistant to new languages as a whole.  PHP has its flaws.  One day it will be replaced (just like .NET, RoR, and even Java) but I don't think that day is tomorrow or the day after, so I don't feel pressure to move on yet.  I think RoR is doing some great things for the development community as a whole.  Some things I see in RoR, I adopt in PHP.  That kind of thing is good for all of us.  But <strong>again</strong>, just because I don't choose to use RoR, doesn't mean that if something else came along I wouldn't take the time to consider how it might could benefit me.  At some point I'm sure I'll re-assess RoR, and who knows, maybe I'll dive in.  Right now, it just doesn't make sense for me to.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>(Fair warning, if you aren't a nerd, you might want to skip this post)</p>

<p>Are we (programmers, developers, engineers) still really having these debates?  Give me a break.  Java vs. .NET, Java vs. PHP, .NET vs. PHP, now Ruby on Rails vs. PHP.</p>

<p>The other day, <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/5/15/hi-i-m-ruby-on-rails-part-2">sent</a> <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/5/16/hi-i-m-ruby-on-rails-part-3">me</a> <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/5/21/hi-i-m-ruby-on-rails-part-4">these</a>.  They're a series of videos created by Ruby on Rails fans, basically comparing PHP vs. Rails.  I watched the videos and told Jeremy something along the lines of, "they're funny, but they're not really a valid comparison of the languages."  I'll be honest, I'm too lazy to look up his initial response, but at some point he told me, "they're entirely valid comparisons."</p>

<p>My main point was that if you only compare based on what the video's show, PHP is capable of doing everything Rails is, although the videos, if you knew nothing about the two languages, would lead you to believe that wasn't the case.  I conceded the point that at least to some extent, Rails would win when it comes to Migrations.  But even that, you can mimic in some way for PHP, but it might not be QUITE as easily done.  You can, without much trouble in fact, abstract your database from your code, you can do MVC,  you can do OOP (in fact PHP5 has greatly extended OOP in PHP).</p>

<p>Then I allowed myself to be pulled into the language vs. language debate (although he will most likely claim that somehow we weren't having a language vs. language debate).  It was all quite silly ... on both sides if I'm being entirely honest.</p>

<p>I like the fact that PHP will let me put together a quick script without having to go through MVC/OOP/etc etc if that's all I want to do.  I like that it doesn't make assumptions about how I'm going to set things up, I also like that if I want to get very structured, or even apply a framework, I can.  He believes that the fact that Rails forces (force is my word, he would most likely say it just makes a certain way so easy why would you choose another) you into a structure is a plus for the language/framework.  He even went on to say/imply that a language that didn't force that was inferior.</p>

<p>Some of the silliness came in to play later.  For instance I think some of the helpers and whatnot available in Rails, while lowering the entrance barrier for new programmers, also create lazy programmers that don't actually know how things are actually being done, or why it is being done that way.  It was silly because earlier in the discussion I had argued that just because PHP allows sloppy code to be written, doesn't mean the language is at fault, the programmer is at fault.  I still don't really back off of either of my points, I guess that line is just a little fuzzy for me.  But I will admit that I could see how me arguing it one direction in one instance then flipping could be seen as odd.</p>

<p>Then later he made the comment that one of the problems in our discussions was we were comparing PHP (the language) to Rails (a framework).  That being silly because everything up to that point, and past that point was and continued to be comparing PHP to Rails.  Somewhere along the lines I asked if we were comparing PHP to Ruby or PHP to Ruby on Rails.  Because if we were comparing PHP to Ruby, the videos were just nonsense.  If we were comparing to Rails then we'd need to introduce Cake or Code Igniter on the PHP side, which would again make the videos invalid.  He, in some fashion, agreed.  Not sure why we continued from there, but we did.</p>

<p>He argued that the great thing about working within the framework and doing things the easiest/forced way was good for when picking up projects from others.  My opinion is, you can easily setup standards and processes to create maintainable code within your organization regardless of your chosen language.  So that leaves us with having to deal with picking up projects from outside developers.  If you think that enough development firms are going to pick up one language so that when acquiring projects from another development firm that it will be easier because it's written in your language, you're living in a dream world.</p>

<p>Somewhere he brought up that he thinks PHP programmers are eventually going to go the way of the mainframe programmer, using COBOL as an example.  Honestly, one day, that will probably be the case, but good grief that is a premature statement.  There are organizations that would label PHP as cutting edge (I wouldn't agree, but regardless, me myself and I are not the majority), not to mention the large number of large sites running PHP (Wikipedia, Digg, Facebook just to name a few), and Yahoo's involvement in the community.  I would say PHP is still growing, if not exploding.  It's hardly the time to be making funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>So anyhow, I think I'm done ranting about this, but needed to throw it out there.  Just to be clear, I think Ruby and Ruby on Rails are great.  I consider them powerful tools for development and have not and will not ever consider someone silly for wanting to learn them, nor will I think that my tool-set (PHP + framework or no framework) are somehow superior. I know the language vs. language debate is not going to end here and now.  It never will.  But, GAH!  I'm sick of it.  Use what you want to use.  User experience is what ultimately matters and they're all capable of providing similar if not exactly alike experiences.  Anyone who disagrees with that needs to come out of their cave.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>A couple of days ago a coworker shared a link to a <a href="http://positivesharing.com/2006/03/how-not-to-lead-geeks/">blog post about how not to manage geeks</a> with me.  Then recently I saw it turn up on Digg.  I took a few moments to respond to him with what I thought in regards to the points, and thought that I might share those here as well.  I'm not going to quote EVERYTHING from the original post, so I recommend you go over and read it to see the explanation that was placed with each of these points before reading my responses below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1: Downplay training</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh ... I don't mind teaching myself stuff.  I actually learn better this way.  I'm willing to admit that I might very well be an exception on this though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2: Give no recognition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely important.  I personally don't need public recognition as much as just an occasional, "Hey, that was pretty sweet how you did x"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3: Plan too much overtime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously this is bad.  Bad as in planning overtime is bad, not as in the point is bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4: Use management-speak</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally just don't have time for people that feel they need to use the full extent of their vocabulary in every-day speak.  I've previously worked places where folks were like this a lot, and it was annoying a lot.  It's not that I can't follow the conversation, but ... get to the frickin point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5: Try to be smarter than the geeks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AMEN!  Probably one of my favorite points on the list.  Some of the best management advice I ever heard was, "Surround yourself with people that are smarter then you.  Then listen to them."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6: Act inconsistent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well ... I don't disagree with it, but this isn't particular to managing geeks.  Managers of all types do this.  Yes its bad, but the day I find an employer that doesn't do it ... I'll kiss their feet.  I don't think I'll be kissing feet anytime in my life, heh.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>7: Ignore the geeks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, this happens.  I don't really get affected by it to be honest.  I will admit that it is a large factor in me viewing jobs as just a paycheck and nothing more though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>8: Make decisions without consulting them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup.  I agree.  This nearly goes hand-in-hand with point #5 if you ask me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9: Don't give them tools</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's nice so long as the company can afford it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10: Forget that geeks are creative workers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably my favorite on the list.  I look at programming as engineering.  My Dad was/is an Industrial Engineer.  When you need to build something that's never been done before, who do you call?  Someone like him.  It's the same thing with us in web programming.  Sure, we may not be re-inventing the wheel every day, but our application of the tools we have is rarely the same any two times, and sometimes we're completely figuring it out on our own.  It is a creative process. People forget this FAR too often.</p></div>
