	<div class="post-content"><p>So I had been saying that I wasn't going to bother getting a new iPad.  I've previously owned the original iPad and the iPad 2, but sold both shortly before the next generation was released.  Around the time I sold my iPad 2, I realized that my usage of it had dropped sharply and I just didn't feel I had a strong need for the device since I have a MacBook Air.  One of the key things I liked about the iPad was the "Instant On" functionality.  But an Air is pretty close to instant on and it's a full computer.</p>

<p>I still might not need an iPad.  Actually, I'm quite certain I don't NEED one.  But there are times that it is nice to have one.  </p>

<p>After getting the new iPad, I also picked up this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Built-In-Stand-920-003402/dp/B0054JE706/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332970963&amp;sr=8-1">Keyboard Case</a> that Logitech makes.  Operating System aside, this basically makes the iPad into a tiny netbook.  I've found that having the keyboard also makes the iPad a good replacement for my laptop at times (e.g. writing non-short emails, blog posts, etc).</p>

<p>Another example of when it's nice to have an iPad is while traveling.  My MacBook has commonly been coming along as well.  But having the iPad with us generally means that Carrie doesn't need to bother bringing her laptop (a 17" behemoth).  If we both happen to want to respond to email at the same time or look online for things in the area where we're traveling, then between my laptop and the iPad we're pretty much covered.  This also allows us to have a full computer with us in case something comes up from work, etc.</p>

<p>In terms of the device itself, I'm actually not quite as impressed with it as I thought I would be.  With how most folks had been drooling over the display, I think my hopes had just gotten too high.  Sure, if I see an app with a non-retina icon sitting on the iPad home screen I can see the pixelation.  But I guess I was expecting the increased resolution to somehow make the apps feel more life-like.  I think this is just a case of reviews getting my hopes up too high for what the display could deliver.</p>

<p>Let me be clear though, I'm not "hatin" on the device.  Browsing the web is easy, as it should be, games are fun and the endless utilities available on the AppStore can be quite helpful.  I don't think Apple is in any trouble of losing its hold as maker of the best tablet on the market.  It's a great tablet device and I do seem to be getting some good use out of it, so I'm happy with my purchase.</p></div>

<p>My desk is a simple Ikea desk and I have a Dell 24-inch monitor set up.  I try to keep it pretty minimal.  I used my iPhone to take the picture so you can't see it with the handset to the left of my keyboard, but here's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FMVCRU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mattwaltersne-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003FMVCRU">product on Amazon</a>.  The laptop is a 13-inch MacBook Air.  I also have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125XBHG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mattwaltersne-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00125XBHG">Mirra Chair by Herman Miller</a>.</p>

<p>The picture doesn't show it but hanging from the back of the desk is a cable organizer (also from Ikea) that keeps all of my cords mostly out of my way except for where they drop down for power on the lower left.</p>

<p>Note: don't ask me why the cat (Sprocket) likes to sleep in the dog crate.  It doesn't make sense to me either.</p></div>

<p>I find myself surprisingly saddened about the death of Steve Jobs. I feel sort of hokey saying that, but the main reason I feel sad is that he didn't get more time to spend with his family after leaving Apple.</p>

<p>I thank him greatly for his contributions to the things I enjoy in my everyday life but I'd gladly give it all up if he could have another day with his family.</p>

<p>He'll be greatly missed.</p></div>

<p>So WordCamp RVA was today and I was really pleased with how well it turned out.  There were periods today where I was nervous about my presentation, then other periods where I figured it would be fine.  There were times (in the morning) where I was worried if eveything would work out well and whether or not enough people were coming, but in the end I think it turned out great.  Folks seemed to be happy with the content and attendance was just about perfect I think.</p>

<p>It really blew me away that we had folks traveling up from Georgia for the event.  I mean ... wow.  Guys, if you read this blog, let's get a WordCamp Atlanta going on.  I'll help.  There's no reason Georgia shouldn't be able to support it's own WordCamp.</p>

<p>As I said at the event, and have mentioned on twitter, etc, I'm really hoping to organize some follow up events to the main WordCamp Richmond (/RVA) event.  I'd like to focus them on real in depth topics like theme development where we actually take some time and build a theme from scratch.  I'd also like to do the same with plugins.  Plugin development was something I was reluctant to cut from my presentation, but I knew there just wasn't going to be time for it, and it's also a topic that would be really hard to present without giving so many code examples that a lot of the crowd would have been put to sleep.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I would like to give a huge thanks, once again, to <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/">Andrew Miller</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/gatewood5000">Chris Gatewood</a>, and <a href="http://businessbullpen.com/">Business Bullpen</a> along with all the other that helped make today happen.  I may have been in the middle of it all, but they made it easy on me and I really can't thank them all enough.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Well, it's been awhile since I've appeared in a newspaper ;)  Last time, I found myself on the front page of the Richmond Times Dispatch for an article about blogging.  Unfortunately I don't still have a copy of the article on my computer, only a hard copy.  Anyhow, this time is not nearly as splashy, but still cool all the same.  A couple weeks back a reporter for the Wall Street Journal contacted me in reference to this article I wrote about <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2009/01/16/on-being-green/">being green</a>.  Here's the part he quoted me on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new TVs are finding favor with some consumers. After getting a $186 
  electric bill in early December, Matt Walters, a Web developer in 
  Richmond, Va., decided to look for ways to reduce his electricity use. 
  He quickly targeted his 50-inch plasma TV, which has a digital video r
  ecorder, Blu-ray player and other devices connected to it.</p>
  
  <p>"I started looking for devices that were more guilty than others," says 
  Mr. Walters, 29. "The plasma TV was one of the first things" he identified.</p>
  
  <p>Mr. Walters bought a few power strips to connect the TV and other devices 
  together and got in the habit of turning it off when he wasn't using it. 
  When his electric bill arrived the next month, he says to his surprise he 
  saved $27. He plans to pay more attention to the power use of the electronics 
  he buys, and adds that he would consider an energy-efficient TV for his 
  next purchase.</p>
</blockquote>
