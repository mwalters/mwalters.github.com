	<div class="post-content"><p>Another year is coming to an end today and I'm finally getting around to writing this post, the third in my series of <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">year end reviews</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long and eventful year.  Maybe it would be best to update based on the different parts of my life.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I started off the year working as a contractor at <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">WordPress HelpCenter</a>.  It was a great experience and even though I have now left WPHC, I still think very highly of the company and Alex King, its founder.  In the beginning of the year, I was the lead for the team.  I grew a lot as a developer, a sales person, and as a customer service rep.  It was a fast paced environment, likely the most fast paced I've ever worked in.  Towards the end of Fall I was presented with a new opportunity to work on-site with a local company, <a href="http://www.snagajob.com/">SnagAJob</a>.</p>

<p>So far SnagAJob has been great.  I'm continuing to grow as a developer and am still able to work with WordPress and PHP (my areas of expertise).  I am really enjoying getting to know the folks I work with and am finally getting around to trying Test Driven Develoment with Unit Tests.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>You may remember me having <a href="/2009/12/27/2009-year-end-review/">mentioned Carrie last year</a>.  We moved in together around May and have been traveling a good bit this year.  We've been to Phoenix AZ, Boulder CO, Baltimore MD, Las Vegas NV, and New York NY.  That's probably more traveling then I've done in the past five years combined and also represents the furthest West I've ever traveled.  We had a lot of good times and eventually I'm going to get around to posting some of the pictures we've taken on this website.  Around our one year anniversary, I decided to ask her to marry me and, amazingly, she said yes.</p>

<p>We're working on plans for the wedding and have booked a venue and set a date, October 8th 2011.  We've started a <a href="http://mattpluscarrie.com/">website</a> to let folks know what we're up to with plans and "us" in general.</p>

<h3>Hobby</h3>

<p>I haven't been as active with my photography as I have been in the past.  This might seem odd given all the travel we've done this year, but I've been trying to focus a little more on living/enjoying the experience rather then trying to document it with my camera and missing what it is I'm photographing.</p>

<p>I've been continuing to work with WordPress a lot both in my work and free time.  I assisted in organizing WordCamp 2010 again this year.  This time around I was mainly acting as a "care-taker" of the event.  All thanks and recognition should go to Carrie &amp; Hunter at <a href="http://studiosavvydesign.com/">studioSavvy</a>, and Andrew of <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/">Your Search Advisor</a>.  They took care of working out the schedule, locating sponsors, etc.  I'd say it was even more successful then last year and that's entirely thanks to the three of them.</p>

<p>I think that pretty much covers some of the larger highlights of the year and let's you know where I am.  Let's hope all goes well in 2011 :)</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Last year I started a <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">series of Year End Review posts</a>.  I figured it would be good to continue it this year as so much has happened in my life in 2009, that it's likely not many people know where or what I'm doing any longer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the year started off poorly.  Early in the year, as the economy tanked, I came really close to losing my job.  The guys I was working for fought long and hard though and were able to keep pulling in enough business to allow me to stay on which I greatly appreciated.  Around this same time, I thought it might be good to start cultivating other opportunities if I needed them.  I took a look at the things I was doing and what I really enjoyed, and thought about how to start making that be able to support me.</p>

<p>Early in the year, I announced that I would be organizing <a href="http://wordcamprichmond.org/">WordCamp Richmond</a>.  It is an all day event where folks get together and discuss all things related to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, the powerful blogging and Content Management System for websites.  It also helped me to get my name out there in the local area to let folks know that I was around and could help them work with this tool.  Anyhow, the event came and went, and was a great success.  We had more attendee's then I thought we would, the speakers all performed amazingly, and we're already planning another again in 2010.</p>

<p>Not too long after WordCamp I purchased a new-to-me car, a 2006 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157619443567630/">Subaru Outback</a>, LL Bean.  It's been doing great and really helped out with all the snow we got a week or two back.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157611702737938/">Atticus</a> enjoys riding around in the back and it's an extremely comfortable car to ride around in.</p>

<p>Let's not forget that I also met and started dating Carrie this year :)  We get along great and have spent a lot of time together the past couple of weeks.  Atticus approves of her, so you know she's good stuff.  She attended WordCamp and at some point after it we started talking, and then talking some more, and eventually I worked up the nerve to ask her out and she said yes.  Things have been great ever since.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Summer, I switched jobs to become a contractor at Capital One.  This was my second time back and I enjoyed it, however my stay was brief.  In November, I began speaking with a friend in Denver, CO about a new opportunity.  The new opportunity involves me managing and staffing a <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">help center for WordPress</a>.  Individuals can call or email us, and receive professional support for their sites/themes/plugins at reasonable prices.  I started work on December 7th and so far things are going great.</p>

<p>So it has been a bumpy year, switching jobs, meeting new folks, starting my business, and many other things.  Even though is seems the year flew by, I'm not sure I can say it was because I was having so much fun.  I'm just hoping that some of what I accomplished this year is going to let me have more fun in the coming years.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>The year is coming to an end, and friends and family keep sending me letters saying what's been up with them this year.  Just tonight I received an email from a friend and they said they had opted to go electronic this year for their letter.  That sounded like a pretty good idea.  I've never written one of these, but I figure my blog is a good platform for it, however I will ask that you bear with me since it's my first time with one of these :)</p>

<p>The beginning of the year was somewhat turbulent for me.  It was riddled with sickness and general unpleasantness.  It all started with <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/01/24/wisdom-teeth-are-out-and-i-kinda-regret-it/">having my wisdom teeth removed</a>.  Unfortunately something went wrong in the procedure, and the result was the front portion of my lower jaw/lip was left numb.  Luckily feeling slowly started returning to it, and now there's only a very small part that isn't 100%.  I'm starting to think that's permanent, but at least it's not annoying.  Within a week after that, I came down with a cold, and then shortly after that, the flu, or something equally bad.  Needless to say, January/February pretty much sucked.</p>

<p>I wish I could say that was the end of the bad news.  Shortly after that, I ended up finding myself on the way to Mississippi because my Grandfather passed away.  Then, my employer at the time, started having lay-off's.  Unfortunately some people I had grown pretty close to found themselves without a job.</p>

<p>Luckily, things started turning around about mid-year.  I moved into a townhouse (more space!).  Most (all?) of my friends seem to be doing great on the job-front (never doubted that they'd turn out any different) and I've managed to stay fairly close with most of them.  Also, in July, I accepted a position with a new company (Business Bullpen), still doing Web Development.  So far it's been pretty fun.  I'm getting to work on some pretty mind-blowing high profile websites, and I got to move towards developing more heavily with WordPress on some other sites.  Graham and Todd are fun to work with, and I'd probably say I feel more "at home" with this job then any other I've ever had.  That's not just because I get to work from home a lot either ;)</p>

<p>Towards the end of this year I've found myself commuting to Charlottesville twice a week, and probably getting too addicted to TV shows -- True Blood, Entourage, Heroes, House, The Office, 30 Rock, Stargate Atlantis (which is letting me down for its series finale), and some others here and there.</p>

<p>So even though 2008 started off more rocky then I would have liked, at least it finally picked up and things look good for 2009 (knock on wood).  I hope to continue with my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/tag/pic-of-the-day/">Picture of the Day Series</a>, try to get better at staying connected with friends, and keep moving forward.</p></div>

<p>My father passed away last night after having spent over a year fighting cancer.  I can't express in words how proud of him I am for how hard he fought given everything he was up against.  We'll all miss him.</p>
