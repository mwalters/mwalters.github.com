<p>So here it is.  I've been working on a static site generator for the past couple of weeks and I finally have things put together enough to start running my site off of it.  The project is called <a href="https://github.com/mwalters/markd">markd</a> and it's hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>.</p>

<p>The overview of how the system works is you create files (posts) that are written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> syntax.  markd will then generate a static HTML version of your blog from those files.  It makes everything you see here.</p>

<p>I would say it's still very alpha at the moment, and even when it is stable it will still be something of more interest to developers rather than the average blogger.  The installation and setup instructions basically don't exist, but will be coming in the future.</p>

<p>Here are the basic reasons why I wrote it:</p>

<ul>
<li>I needed a new hobby project :)</li>
<li>Having a static HTML site just seemed to make sense for various reasons</li>
<li>It was a bit of an exercise in some development areas that I wanted to work out</li>
<li>Creating Markdown files is so easy and the way I have this all set up, makes writing a new post both simple and something I can easily enjoy in my favorite text editor</li>
<li>Really, it's just something that I had a strong interest in and decided to run with it.  I'm happy with how it's turned out.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're curious how it works, here is how I have things set up:</p>

<ul>
<li>I write blog posts in a text editor, with the Markdown syntax.  They're saved on Dropbox so I can access them from any computer.</li>
<li>I run markd which is a PHP-CLI set of scripts that generates the HTML for my home page, single post pages, archives, etc.</li>
<li>Those files are then automatically published to my web server using a set of not-included shell scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm enjoying working on it and have <a href="https://github.com/mwalters/markd/issues?labels=&amp;milestone=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">plans for things to do in the future</a> like enhancing the theme engine, adding hooks for a plugin system and support for some different post formats.  At this point you might be thinking this is starting to sound a lot like <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, or many of the other blogging engines, including the others that create static sites.  Well, you'd be correct.</p>

<p>I wanted this project to do things the way <em>I</em> wanted them done.  It's definitely taking hints from WordPress, and I also intend to take some hints from the <a href="http://carringtontheme.com/">Carrington Theme Framework</a> for the theme engine.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to where this might go.  Who knows, maybe working on markd might get me blogging frequently again since I'll be developing it and want to try things out.</p></div>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I'm still working at <a href="http://www.snagajob.com/">Snagajob</a>.  Things are going well.  This year we received the #1 small business to work for award and had <a href="http://youtu.be/c-YaPGD5LTo">Governor McDonnell visit us</a>.  There were <a href="http://youtu.be/c5EjjhOU40w">some</a> other <a href="http://youtu.be/4arh94UzwzY">moments</a> that <a href="http://youtu.be/dyrmmDWuWxg">were</a> quite <a href="http://youtu.be/blVhDDkCxjw">funny</a> throughout the <a href="http://youtu.be/_hZj6Qe1XBI">year</a> as well.  We also showed <a href="http://youtu.be/PhlSRCp3lfw">we're not perfect</a> (that's one of my favorites).</p>

<p>I'm getting to work on some exciting projects that unfortunately I can't talk too much about but I think there is some big stuff in store for our members in 2012 :)</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>Carrie and I got married on October 8th, 2011.</p>

<p>The wedding was awesome, the weather was perfect, and we had a great group of family and friends to share the day with.  Shortly after our wedding we left for Kauai on our honeymoon.  We spent 10 days there and I <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/14/6084/">shared</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/16/autograph-tree/">many</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/18/m-c/">many</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/16/oh/">pictures</a> while we were there.  I would say my favorite part of the trip was the snorkeling trip we took which also gave us a boat tour of the <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/17/napali-coast/">Na Pali coast</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks after we got back from Hawaii we adopted our second dog, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/30/put-in-an-application-to-hopefully-adopt-this-little-guy/">Marco</a>.  Then not too long after that, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/11/23/atticus-found-marcos-bed-last-night-marco-15lb-atticus-85lb/">Atticus decided to see if he could fit in Marco's bed</a> (keep in mind, Marco is about 1/5th the size of Atticus).  Marco is full of energy, but every once in a while he tuckers out and it's pretty damn cute when <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/11/19/tired-marco/">he does</a>.</p>

<p>That is all probably way to short to really speak to all the exciting things that happened this year but I think it covers the major highlights.  I hope everyone is doing well and has a great holiday.</p></div>

<p>I find myself surprisingly saddened about the death of Steve Jobs. I feel sort of hokey saying that, but the main reason I feel sad is that he didn't get more time to spend with his family after leaving Apple.</p>

<p>I thank him greatly for his contributions to the things I enjoy in my everyday life but I'd gladly give it all up if he could have another day with his family.</p>

<p>He'll be greatly missed.</p></div>

">May 26th, 2011</a>
		 in <a href="/category/articles-0.html">Articles</a>	</div>
	<div class="post-content"><p>I have had programming language debates in the past.  I've recently been having similar discussions and realized some things.  Arguing one language against another is a religious debate that will never be won.  I realized it wasn't about #winning.  It would be more valuable to change the discussion to why I chose PHP and continue developing with it to this day.<!--more--></p>

<p>Total disclosure, one of the key reasons I chose PHP originally was because it was easy to find an inexpensive web host that supported it.  In fact the web host I was using at the time already supported it.  I didn't have to worry about licensing fee's, there were many hosts supporting it, and I was already using web applications built on it.  Those are pretty simple reasons, and certainly reasons that could have changed over time.  For instance, unlike when I was 20 and learning PHP, these days I could afford the licensing fee's if I chose to.  The key thing that has kept me with PHP is the documentation and community.</p>

<p>The documentation for PHP itself is unrivaled with other languages from what I've seen.  PHP.net is a fantastic learning resource and was a huge help when I was getting started.  I could easily browse available functions, and didn't need to search across tons of blogs for likely out of date information.  If I needed to sort an array I could look up sort() and as well as providing me the syntax/parameters, at the bottom of the page it would list other array sorting functions which I could check to see if they better met my needs based on what I was doing in my application.  This matured documentation also exists in other places within PHP.  For example in WordPress, the documentation is fairly strong.  It's not always completely up to date, but the fact it's as comprehensive as it is places it head and shoulders above many other open source programs.</p>

<p>The community is definitely the key feature for me with PHP.  I find it both welcoming and accepting of various skill levels.  I find folks in the PHP community commonly focus on getting stuff done and eagerly teach and share with each other.  There's not much meaningless focus on academic debates or pontificating to boost one's own ego.  That's not to say those things never happens in the PHP community, but I find it happening less often in the world of PHP.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why lots of folks like to consider PHP the red-headed stepchild of web development, but they do.  When developers of other languages do start attacking PHP or my use of it, they're usually just reminding me of why I like my choice of PHP in the first place.  It would probably be a more meaningful discussion for all of us if they'd instead try to show me why they chose their preferred language instead of trying to compare it feature for feature with PHP and simply answering my questions while respectfully understanding if I don't agree about whether I should be using their preferred language.</p></div>
