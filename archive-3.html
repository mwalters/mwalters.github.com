<p>I find myself surprisingly saddened about the death of Steve Jobs. I feel sort of hokey saying that, but the main reason I feel sad is that he didn't get more time to spend with his family after leaving Apple.</p>

<p>I thank him greatly for his contributions to the things I enjoy in my everyday life but I'd gladly give it all up if he could have another day with his family.</p>

<p>He'll be greatly missed.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>I have had programming language debates in the past.  I've recently been having similar discussions and realized some things.  Arguing one language against another is a religious debate that will never be won.  I realized it wasn't about #winning.  It would be more valuable to change the discussion to why I chose PHP and continue developing with it to this day.<!--more--></p>

<p>Total disclosure, one of the key reasons I chose PHP originally was because it was easy to find an inexpensive web host that supported it.  In fact the web host I was using at the time already supported it.  I didn't have to worry about licensing fee's, there were many hosts supporting it, and I was already using web applications built on it.  Those are pretty simple reasons, and certainly reasons that could have changed over time.  For instance, unlike when I was 20 and learning PHP, these days I could afford the licensing fee's if I chose to.  The key thing that has kept me with PHP is the documentation and community.</p>

<p>The documentation for PHP itself is unrivaled with other languages from what I've seen.  PHP.net is a fantastic learning resource and was a huge help when I was getting started.  I could easily browse available functions, and didn't need to search across tons of blogs for likely out of date information.  If I needed to sort an array I could look up sort() and as well as providing me the syntax/parameters, at the bottom of the page it would list other array sorting functions which I could check to see if they better met my needs based on what I was doing in my application.  This matured documentation also exists in other places within PHP.  For example in WordPress, the documentation is fairly strong.  It's not always completely up to date, but the fact it's as comprehensive as it is places it head and shoulders above many other open source programs.</p>

<p>The community is definitely the key feature for me with PHP.  I find it both welcoming and accepting of various skill levels.  I find folks in the PHP community commonly focus on getting stuff done and eagerly teach and share with each other.  There's not much meaningless focus on academic debates or pontificating to boost one's own ego.  That's not to say those things never happens in the PHP community, but I find it happening less often in the world of PHP.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why lots of folks like to consider PHP the red-headed stepchild of web development, but they do.  When developers of other languages do start attacking PHP or my use of it, they're usually just reminding me of why I like my choice of PHP in the first place.  It would probably be a more meaningful discussion for all of us if they'd instead try to show me why they chose their preferred language instead of trying to compare it feature for feature with PHP and simply answering my questions while respectfully understanding if I don't agree about whether I should be using their preferred language.</p></div>

<p>After last weeks Amazon Web Services (AWS) issues, everyone is talking a lot about "The Cloud" and whether it's the right answer for many companies.  I'm a pretty big fan of virtual servers, but I can't say that they are for everyone.  When designing any sort of environment I would say there are some, what should seem simple, ideas to keep in mind:  <!--more--></p>

<h3>Know your uptime requirements:</h3>

<p>Can your business/website withstand being down for 6-12 hours?  I would say most can, probably far more than think they could.  Some organizations over architect their environments because brief amounts of downtime are unpalatable to them when the simple fact is their users will forgive temporary downtime as long as it doesn't become the norm.  Regardless, your organization needs to figure out what your uptime requirements are and architect to those requirements.  If you need extreme amounts of uptime then you need servers/services spread across multiple availability zones if you're with a single provider, and you possibly need to have services in place across multiple providers so you can recover as quickly as possible if something does go wrong.  How far you need to take this will all be determined by your requirements and help you create your Plan B for when things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<h3>Have a Plan B:</h3>

<p>Once you have your uptime requirements in place, you can start formulating a Plan B.  This might include using your load balancer to point at a different availability zone, or it might mean quick DNS changes to point your site to a back-up provider.  Short of that though you need to test failures at a lower level.  What if just one of your UI servers dies, what happens?  Hopefully your application can easily sustain something like this and requests quickly re-route to another server.  Similarly, hopefully the services that your UI servers talk to can easily handle single failures like this.</p>

<h3>Test your Plan B:</h3>

<p><strong>This is important.</strong>  Make sure that things behave how you expect them to.  Shut down one of your UI servers, or your back-end services.  Do things react how you planned?  If not, then fix it so that they do.  What you do not want to have happen is you end up in a situation where your server has failed and brought your site down or your provider starts having cascading failures and you are at the mercy of their email support.  If your plan does all work as planned then great!  Test it periodically and fix things when they come up (you will need to make corrections to your plan as your service grows!), then you can rest easier at night.</p>

<p>At this point you might find yourself wondering about cost, complexity, etc.  I saw a tweet recently that I related to these thoughts:</p>

<p>http://twitter.com/#!/kylecordes/status/61540471767449601</p>

<p>I'm not sure of his exact meaning here but how I interpreted it brings me back to my first point, knowing your requirements.  The cloud is not necessarily inexpensive and is often more complex then having a simpler set up with a dedicated server or two hosted with your favorite provider.  Design for your needs at the time and adapt as they change over time.  You might be just fine hosting in a small environment and keeping good backups that you can restore to another server and/or provider if needed.</p>

<p>You are keeping backups of your data, aren't you?</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Another year is coming to an end today and I'm finally getting around to writing this post, the third in my series of <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">year end reviews</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long and eventful year.  Maybe it would be best to update based on the different parts of my life.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I started off the year working as a contractor at <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">WordPress HelpCenter</a>.  It was a great experience and even though I have now left WPHC, I still think very highly of the company and Alex King, its founder.  In the beginning of the year, I was the lead for the team.  I grew a lot as a developer, a sales person, and as a customer service rep.  It was a fast paced environment, likely the most fast paced I've ever worked in.  Towards the end of Fall I was presented with a new opportunity to work on-site with a local company, <a href="http://www.snagajob.com/">SnagAJob</a>.</p>

<p>So far SnagAJob has been great.  I'm continuing to grow as a developer and am still able to work with WordPress and PHP (my areas of expertise).  I am really enjoying getting to know the folks I work with and am finally getting around to trying Test Driven Develoment with Unit Tests.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>You may remember me having <a href="/2009/12/27/2009-year-end-review/">mentioned Carrie last year</a>.  We moved in together around May and have been traveling a good bit this year.  We've been to Phoenix AZ, Boulder CO, Baltimore MD, Las Vegas NV, and New York NY.  That's probably more traveling then I've done in the past five years combined and also represents the furthest West I've ever traveled.  We had a lot of good times and eventually I'm going to get around to posting some of the pictures we've taken on this website.  Around our one year anniversary, I decided to ask her to marry me and, amazingly, she said yes.</p>

<p>We're working on plans for the wedding and have booked a venue and set a date, October 8th 2011.  We've started a <a href="http://mattpluscarrie.com/">website</a> to let folks know what we're up to with plans and "us" in general.</p>

<h3>Hobby</h3>

<p>I haven't been as active with my photography as I have been in the past.  This might seem odd given all the travel we've done this year, but I've been trying to focus a little more on living/enjoying the experience rather then trying to document it with my camera and missing what it is I'm photographing.</p>

<p>I've been continuing to work with WordPress a lot both in my work and free time.  I assisted in organizing WordCamp 2010 again this year.  This time around I was mainly acting as a "care-taker" of the event.  All thanks and recognition should go to Carrie &amp; Hunter at <a href="http://studiosavvydesign.com/">studioSavvy</a>, and Andrew of <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/">Your Search Advisor</a>.  They took care of working out the schedule, locating sponsors, etc.  I'd say it was even more successful then last year and that's entirely thanks to the three of them.</p>

<p>I think that pretty much covers some of the larger highlights of the year and let's you know where I am.  Let's hope all goes well in 2011 :)</p></div>
