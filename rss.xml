							<description><![CDATA[<p>So I had been saying that I wasn't going to bother getting a new iPad.  I've previously owned the original iPad and the iPad 2, but sold both shortly before the next generation was released.  Around the time I sold my iPad 2, I realized that my usage of it had dropped sharply and I just didn't feel I had a strong need for the device since I have a MacBook Air.  One of the key things I liked about the iPad was the "Instant On" functionality.  But an Air is pretty close to instant on and it's a full computer.</p>

<p>I still might not need an iPad.  Actually, I'm quite certain I don't NEED one.  But there are times that it is nice to have one.  </p>

<p>After getting the new iPad, I also picked up this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Built-In-Stand-920-003402/dp/B0054JE706/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332970963&amp;sr=8-1">Keyboard Case</a> that Logitech makes.  Operating System aside, this basically makes the iPad into a tiny netbook.  I've found that having the keyboard also makes the iPad a good replacement for my laptop at times (e.g. writing non-short emails, blog posts, etc).</p>

<p>Another example of when it's nice to have an iPad is while traveling.  My MacBook has commonly been coming along as well.  But having the iPad with us generally means that Carrie doesn't need to bother bringing her laptop (a 17" behemoth).  If we both happen to want to respond to email at the same time or look online for things in the area where we're traveling, then between my laptop and the iPad we're pretty much covered.  This also allows us to have a full computer with us in case something comes up from work, etc.</p>

<p>In terms of the device itself, I'm actually not quite as impressed with it as I thought I would be.  With how most folks had been drooling over the display, I think my hopes had just gotten too high.  Sure, if I see an app with a non-retina icon sitting on the iPad home screen I can see the pixelation.  But I guess I was expecting the increased resolution to somehow make the apps feel more life-like.  I think this is just a case of reviews getting my hopes up too high for what the display could deliver.</p>

<p>Let me be clear though, I'm not "hatin" on the device.  Browsing the web is easy, as it should be, games are fun and the endless utilities available on the AppStore can be quite helpful.  I don't think Apple is in any trouble of losing its hold as maker of the best tablet on the market.  It's a great tablet device and I do seem to be getting some good use out of it, so I'm happy with my purchase.</p>]]></description>

							<title>Hi Company, have my wallet</title>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I don't understand why companies think they should be allowed to ETF my checking acct when they won't let me do the same to theirs</p>&mdash; Matt Walters (@mwalters) <a href="https://twitter.com/mwalters/status/177773804632813568" data-datetime="2012-03-08T15:12:32+00:00">March 8, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I think it's pretty obvious why a company would want this from their perspective.  Many Americans keep their mortgage payment, car payment, etc… in their checking account.  It's sort of the purpose for the account after all and they know the consumer will try to keep the account padded.  So companies want access because they know it's one of their best chances at getting cash from you reliably.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120308-kbh9ibyh7ambhfbse1qs7kir9x.jpg" align="left" alt="Cash Wallet" style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" />I say giving a company access to auto-draft your checking account is tantamount to opening your wallet toward them and saying, "here, take what you need."  </p>

<p>The very reasons that companies want this sort of unfettered access to your money are the same exact reasons that you should be protecting it like it's your own personal Fort Knox.</p>

<p>What if the company has a billing error?  Who hasn't experienced that before?  With access to your checking account it could leave you strapped to pay other bills.  By the time you deal with their over-sea's billing department or whatever absurd processes they have in place, it could take a long period of time to get things straightened out.</p>

<p>I'm not saying all automatic recurring payments are bad.  But if you want to bill me like that, have a credit card payment as an option.  I understand it means you have to pay processing fees, but honestly, I don't care.</p>

<p>At least then the consumer has a buffer between their checking account and the company.  As a consumer it's good too because your credit card company should be someone you can at least reason with if you have a record of being responsible with them, and they might even go to bat with the other company if you need them to and you can prove that it was an error on the part of the billing party.  Worst case, you have the option to pay off the credit card over time and not have it impact your personal cash flow as seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a somewhat cautionary tail</strong></p>

<p>Once I had a DSL provider (Verizon) charge me for 2 months service when connecting me.  This wasn't standard.  It was an <strong>admitted</strong> error on the part of their billing department.  Straigtening it out involved me having to talk to someone in another country, and the best they could offer me was putting it as a credit toward my future service.  They absolutely refused to reverse all or part of the transaction to put my cash back in my account and there was nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>Luckily this was just a low dollar DSL service payment.  But what if it was something larger?  Or what if they'd billed me for a years worth of service?  Mistakes happen at large companies, and leaving the consumer holding the bag over a company error is horrible.</p>

<p>This happened years ago.  But I learned my lesson and I urge you to learn from it too.  Outside of extraordinary circumstances, stop letting companies have such easy access to your cash.</p>]]></description>
