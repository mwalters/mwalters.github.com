							<description><![CDATA[<p>Pretty good article about things over at Etsy.  I particularly liked this quote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re building a technology-driven company, you better have 
  a culture that loves engineers, and I mean love. All too often, 
  I see entrepreneurs who say they "just need engineers" to "bang 
  out the code" for this great idea of theirs. If you view 
  engineers as interchangeable factory workers instead of partners 
  and creative people, you’re in for a tough time getting huge in 
  a world driven by technology.</p>

							<title>Vagrant and Puppet are pretty fun</title>

							<description><![CDATA[<p>I had some good times with <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> this week.  I would easily recommend checking it out if you typically develop <em>for</em> *nix based systems as it can make setting up a local dev environment pretty nice and easy to manage.  Not only that, but you can then share the dev environment with other developers on your team which is great news for folks that play well with others.</p>

<p>You will probably find it to be a bit of a "slow down in order to speed up" routine.  I had previously played with it a little so I was able to dive in pretty fast this time around and found it pretty straight forward after having wrapped my head around it the first time several weeks back.</p>

<p>I originally found out about it by reading the article "<a href="http://phpadvent.org/2011/facilitating-development-environment-consistency-by-jeff-loiselle">Facilitating Development Environment Consistency</a>" over on the <a href="http://phpadvent.org">PHP advent</a> site.  So that might be a good place for you to start if you're interested in the approach.</p>

<p>If you're not already subscribed to PHP Advent or following them on Twitter, I'd highly recommend it.  New articles only come in December of each year but some of them can be pretty stellar.</p>]]></description>

							<title>New job</title>

							<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I started a new job with <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/">MacRumors</a> where I'll be working on that site and others.</p>

<p>It was a tough decision to leave Snagajob.  I got to do a lot of fun things there and helping folks find jobs definitely felt nice.  I was doing a <strong>lot</strong> of WordPress work there along with a healthy serving of straight up front end web development.  </p>

<p>Those are good lead-in's to what I'm excited about with MacRumors.  I'll still be doing some WordPress work I'm sure, and I'm fairly certain I'll be doing plenty of front end web development as well.  But it also sounds like there will be a good bit of opportunity for me to get back to my roots as a PHP developer.  Rather than working primarily in a niche of PHP (e.g. WordPress), I'll get the opportunity to branch back out into more general PHP applications as well as wear many other hats I'm sure.</p>

<p>So here's to new beginnings and the opportunities they bring.</p>]]></description>

							<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the side benefits of markd is that I can now just host my site on github since it's just static HTML.  So I've moved my site over.</p>

<p>Speaking of markd, I've added some more features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Post formats</p>

<p>An example would be my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/category/links-0.html">link posts</a> which you can see are formatted slightly differently than normal posts.  Post formats are defined on the fly based on what you specify in the header section of your markdown files.  If you specify a format then the template engine looks for a corresponding content file in the <code>formats</code> directory inside of your theme.</p></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">Google Code Prettify support</a></li>
<li><p>Subpages are now in subdirectories on the published site</p>

<p>This makes things a little prettier in the published site.</p></li>
<li><p>Category support</p>

<p>Categories are created while the site is being published from what you specify in the header section of your markdown files.  Listing (e.g. archive) pages are created for each category.  You can see an example by looking at my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/category/development-0.html">Development</a> category.</p></li>
<li><p>Template files are now PHP</p>

<p>Using basic string replaces with .tpl files for the theme was going to become painful fast so I switched things up to let template files be PHP which means you can dynamically process things when the site is generated.  This also makes the hook system more straight forward to take advantage of.</p></li>
<li>Now, future dated posts are not published until the date specified in their source markdown file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming up:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tag support</p>

<p>It's possible I may just rename categories to tags and go with the one taxonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>WordPress importer</p>

<p>Maybe my previous content will make an appearance here :)</p></li>
<li>Child theme system</li>
<li><p>FTP Deployments of your site</p>

<p>This is still a maybe.  I'm not sure how useful it will be for the system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Until next time … take care.</p>]]></description>
