							<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the side benefits of markd is that I can now just host my site on github since it's just static HTML.  So I've moved my site over.</p>

<p>Speaking of markd, I've added some more features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Post formats</p>

<p>An example would be my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/category/links-0.html">link posts</a> which you can see are formatted slightly differently than normal posts.  Post formats are defined on the fly based on what you specify in the header section of your markdown files.  If you specify a format then the template engine looks for a corresponding content file in the <code>formats</code> directory inside of your theme.</p></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">Google Code Prettify support</a></li>
<li><p>Subpages are now in subdirectories on the published site</p>

<p>This makes things a little prettier in the published site.</p></li>
<li><p>Category support</p>

<p>Categories are created while the site is being published from what you specify in the header section of your markdown files.  Listing (e.g. archive) pages are created for each category.  You can see an example be looking at my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/category/development-0.html">Development</a> category.</p></li>
<li><p>Template files are now PHP</p>

<p>Using basic string replaces with .tpl files for the theme was going to become painful fast so I switched things up to let template files be PHP which means you can dynamically process things when the site is generated.  This also makes the hook system more straight forward to take advantage of.</p></li>
<li>Future dated posts are now published until their date</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming up:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tag support</p>

<p>It's possible I may just rename categories to tags and go with the one taxonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>WordPress importer</p>

<p>Maybe my previous content will make an appearance here :)</p></li>
<li>Child theme system</li>
<li><p>FTP Deployments of your site</p>

<p>This is still a maybe.  I'm not sure how useful it will be for the system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Until next time … take care.</p>]]></description>

							<title>Updates to markd</title>

							<description><![CDATA[<p>After releasing the first version of markd over the weekend, I'm following it up with a reasonable amount of changes and new features.  </p>

<p>There is now support for Pages.  They're created from a file/directory hierarchy in your content/pages directory.  Along with this a menu with support to up to 2 levels deep can be generated.  This might be easier to explain by example.  Let's assume you have a directory structure that looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>/content

<ul>
<li>/pages

<ul>
<li>/about.md</li>
<li>/Projects

<ul>
<li>/markd.md</li>
</ul></li>
<li>/contact.md</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This would generate code that looks like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;ul class="nav"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="dropdown" data-dropdown="dropdown"&gt;
        &lt;a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#"&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;ul class="dropdown-menu"&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="markd.html"&gt;markd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="contact"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

<p>The link names are pulled from the directory name (e.g. "Projects") or from the Title in the markdown file (e.g. "About").  Essentially all you need to do is create a structure and markd will take care of making a menu system for it and linking things up properly.</p>

<p>Also with the support of pages comes support for page templates.  If you need a page to look different, then create a corresponding template file with the same file name inside your theme.  For example, if you wanted your "about.md" page to use a special template, then you can create an "about.tpl" inside the theme and alter the HTML for that page only.  If there's not a specific page template in the theme directory, then it will default to using a generic "page.tpl" from the theme directory.</p>

<p>There's also a simple (for the time being) hook system that was introduced which allows themes/plugins to do some manipulation of the generated site.  Along with markd comes a plugin called Twitter Timeline Widget to show how this can be used to add something to the sidebar of posts/pages.  There is another example in the default theme which depending on whether a JotForm ID is provided, it will either add the Contact Me button (that you see on the right hand side of this page) or not.  This is a little crude at the moment, but I hope to flush it out and make things a little smoother as time goes on.</p>

<p>A lot of other tweaks were made along the way with these features, but you can read commits over on github if you really need to know about that boring stuff :)</p>

<p>Up next:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for categories</li>
<li>Restructuring of pages in the published site (need to build a directory structure rather than cramming it all into the site root)</li>
<li>Child theme system (mainly for me to be able to apply customizations to the default theme)</li>
<li>Post formats (make things like Links or Tweets look different)</li>
<li>Future dated posts won't be published until the proper time even if their published status is set to true</li>
</ul>]]></description>
