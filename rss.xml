							<title>The New iPad</title>

							<description><![CDATA[<p>So I had been saying that I wasn't going to bother getting a new iPad.  I've previously owned the original iPad and the iPad 2, but sold both shortly before the next generation was released.  Around the time I sold my iPad 2, I realized that my usage of it had dropped sharply and I just didn't feel I had a strong need for the device since I have a MacBook Air.  One of the key things I liked about the iPad was the "Instant On" functionality.  But an Air is pretty close to instant on and it's a full computer.</p>

<p>I still might not need an iPad.  Actually, I'm quite certain I don't NEED one.  But there are times that it is nice to have one.  </p>

<p>After getting the new iPad, I also picked up this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Built-In-Stand-920-003402/dp/B0054JE706/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332970963&amp;sr=8-1">Keyboard Case</a> that Logitech makes.  Operating System aside, this basically makes the iPad into a tiny netbook.  I've found that having the keyboard also makes the iPad a good replacement for my laptop at times (e.g. writing non-short emails, blog posts, etc).</p>

<p>Another example of when it's nice to have an iPad is while traveling.  My MacBook has commonly been coming along as well.  But having the iPad with us generally means that Carrie doesn't need to bother bringing her laptop (a 17" behemoth).  If we both happen to want to respond to email at the same time or look online for things in the area where we're traveling, then between my laptop and the iPad we're pretty much covered.  This also allows us to have a full computer with us in case something comes up from work, etc.</p>

<p>In terms of the device itself, I'm actually not quite as impressed with it as I thought I would be.  With how most folks had been drooling over the display, I think my hopes had just gotten too high.  Sure, if I see an app with a non-retina icon sitting on the iPad home screen I can see the pixelation.  But I guess I was expecting the increased resolution to somehow make the apps feel more life-like.  I think this is just a case of reviews getting my hopes up too high for what the display could deliver.</p>

<p>Let me be clear though, I'm not "hatin" on the device.  Browsing the web is easy, as it should be, games are fun and the endless utilities available on the AppStore can be quite helpful.  I don't think Apple is in any trouble of losing its hold as maker of the best tablet on the market.  It's a great tablet device and I do seem to be getting some good use out of it, so I'm happy with my purchase.</p>]]></description>

							<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.responsinator.com/">The Responsinator</a>: Nice way to get a quick look at how a website looks on some various mobile platforms.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.is/">Time.is</a>: Need to know what time it is?</p>

<p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#">All Sites - Stack Exchange</a>: Pretty neat representation of various Stack Exchange sites.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US">Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts</a>: Keyboard shortcuts and how they are mostly the same from one application to another is actually a reason I cite for liking OS X over other platforms.  That along with how I feel the shortcuts are easier to accomplish because of the placement of the Cmd key.  This is a big list, more then I think one person can readily memorize, but I like to check it out from time to time and try to learn a couple of new ones as I go.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions">List of common misconceptions - Wikipedia</a>: My brother mentioned this one to me.  Some of it can be pretty interesting.  Here's one I always heard as a kid in school (really, I never did believe it, but others definitely seemed to):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swallowed chewing gum does not take seven years to digest. In 
  fact, chewing gum is mostly indigestible, but passes through 
  the digestive system at the same rate as other matter.</p>
