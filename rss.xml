Are there any cool (but inexpensive) experiments we could do at home that would blow his mind?</a>: I'm not a 5 year old, but wouldn't mind doing some of these myself, heh</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aboutlinux.info/2005/10/10-seconds-guide-to-bash-shell.html">Bash Shell Scripting - 10 Seconds Guide</a>: I've been getting into some bash/zsh -fu lately.  These are some good fundamentals here that can help.</p>

  <p>The pragmatic way to solve the problem would have been

<p><a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting">Interpreted Languages: PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby</a>: Interesting (for me) to see this all side by side.  I really need to invest in learning Ruby and/or Python one of these days.  I've long wanted to dive into Python but I find myself encountering Ruby or wanting to use things I find that are in Ruby more often, so it will probably win in terms of what I dive into next.  I've been putting off Ruby too long now anyhow.</p>

<p><a href="http://vagrantbox.es/44/">ubuntu 11.04 server amd64 (with puppet support)</a>: As you may remember, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2012/vagrant-and-puppet-are-pretty-fun.html">I have been getting into Vagrant &amp; Puppet</a> lately.  Earlier this week I ran into a problem where the Lucid base image had a bad link between PHP and PCRE.  The easiest way I could figure out to solve this was to get a newer version of Ubuntu.  Just when I thought I was going to need to make a new image for myself I stumbled across this image on <a href="http://vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/">Internet Explorer for Mac the Easy Way: Run IE 7, IE8, &amp; IE9 Free in a Virtual Machine</a>: I'd like this to work, but have been having issues getting any of this to work on my Lion Mac.  Using the MS images seems like a good way to go for me, but it seems this process was made more for linux and is having some issues on my version of OSX perhaps.  Anyhow, if you know a good solution, please share.</p>]]></description>

							<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wpfunction.me/">WordPress functions.php Snippets</a>: Helpful as a starting place when you're setting up a new theme.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osfoora-for-twitter/id502401238?mt=12">Osfoora for Twitter</a>: Client for OSX.  I like that it has tweet marker integration.  I use tweetbot on my iPhone which has this integration as well so I finally have a synced timeline between my laptop and iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/17/stop-writing-project-proposals/">Stop Writing Project Proposals</a>: I could probably write a longer blog post about this alone.  I think my opinions on it might change with a client that I had a standing relationship with.  But for new clients, I agree with the basic idea here.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5885881/top-10-downloads-that-enhance-mac-os-xs-built+in-tools">Top 10 Downloads That Enhance Mac OS X's Built-In Tools</a>: Some of these really are nice.  I used unDock, Palua, and Perian.  I can see others on the list as helpful as well.  I will note though that I tried RestoreMeNot and had issues with it slowing things down when I was tabbing between applications.  Not sure why this was, but as soon as I uninstalled it things went back to being snappy.</p>

<p><a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Free themes for Twitter Bootstrap</a>: Obviously if you look at this site in the browser you can tell that I've become a bit of a fan of Twitter Bootstrap :)  I've been thinking about trying to integrate some of these into <a href="https://github.com/mwalters/markd">markd</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones">I tried to watch Game of Thrones and this is what happened - The Oatmeal</a>: heh…</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/02/secret-service-asks-for-shutdown-of-legit-website-over-user-content-godaddy-complies.ars">Takedowns run amok?</a>: I use JotForms on this site for my contact form and was affected by this.  It's pretty much bullshit if you ask me.</p>

<p><a href="http://pagodabox.com/">Pagoda Box | Scaling PHP Cloud Hosting</a>: I hadn't heard of this service previously.  It sounds interesting and I like the methods they have in place to make deploying with git easy as well as post deploy hooks for things.  I might have to try them out.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/21/dell">Dell's Predicament</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put another way, Dell has no strengths in any 
  market that’s growing. They’re a relic.</p>

							<title>Potluck PHP Framework</title>
							<link>http://mattwalters.net/2012/potluck-php-framework.html</link>
							<pubDate>February 22nd, 2012</pubDate>
							<dc:creator>Matt</dc:creator>
							<guid isPermaLink="false">http://mattwalters.net/2012/potluck-php-framework.html</guid>
							<description><![CDATA[<p>In my free time I've been playing around with some different tools for development and I've sort of come up with a Potluck PHP Framework of sorts.  It's actually not bad and stays pretty lightweight while giving some decent functionality.  Keep in mind, I've not spent extensive time with this setup, but I am liking what I'm encountering so far.  Here's what I've pieced together:</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a>: PHP5 Micro Framework</h3>

<p>It's pretty lightweight and you're not going to find tons of functionality built into it.  But don't let it fool you.  It is pretty easy to extend or build upon and has some important pieces of functionality that a framework should have already built in.</p>

<p>My only "beef" with Slim is probably that it doesn't give a great Controller structure if you're going to take an MVC approach to things.  But I'm still just starting to play with the framework so I might find a way to build in something more like what I'm expecting.  I typically like the CodeIgniter approach on controllers/routes.  I'd like to see if I can figure out a way to minimally recreate that functionality so I can make a new route just by dropping a file/class/method into the appropriate place(s).  For a small site this would be a non-issue anyhow.</p>

<h3><a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>: Template Engine</h3>

<p>This is rather <a href="https://github.com/codeguy/Slim-Extras/blob/master/Views/TwigView.php">easily integrated</a> into Slim and gives you a nice template engine for your views.  I'm typically not a fan of mustache templating systems but Twig is a pretty robust engine.  In my playing around with it, I am finding myself willing to deal with the mustaches in order to gain the advantages Twig is providing.</p>

<h3><a href="http://phpdatamapper.com/">phpDataMapper</a></h3>

<p>phpDataMapper is more or less a port of the <a href="http://datamapper.org/">Ruby DataMapper</a> project.  This is the one I've had the least time spent with of the 3 items on this list.  But I definitely enjoy not having to worry about escaping things for the database, etc., and being able to quickly establish a database back end for the app I'm using this setup with.  I went from no database connection to pulling data out and displaying it on my page in about 5 minutes with phpDataMapper.</p>

<hr />

<p>Could I have done all of this with something like CodeIgniter?  Sure.  I'm a big fan of CodeIgniter so I'm not making this list as an argument against CI or other PHP frameworks.  I will say that I was able to integrate Slim, Twig, and phpDataMapper in about 15 minutes of Googling and typing.</p>

<p>One advantage I could see to using a setup like this is that you get to very explicitly choose where you want to put weight into the framework you're piecing together for your application.  I'm not sure how light-weight Twig and phpDataMapper would be considered, but Slim is definitely light-weight.  Database interactions and rendering are areas that I was ok with adding weight to the application for because of what they provide me.</p>]]></description>

							<description><![CDATA[<p>Pretty good article about things over at Etsy.  I particularly liked this quote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re building a technology-driven company, you better have 
  a culture that loves engineers, and I mean love. All too often, 
  I see entrepreneurs who say they "just need engineers" to "bang 
  out the code" for this great idea of theirs. If you view 
  engineers as interchangeable factory workers instead of partners 
  and creative people, you’re in for a tough time getting huge in 
  a world driven by technology.</p>

							<title>Vagrant and Puppet are pretty fun</title>

							<description><![CDATA[<p>I had some good times with <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> this week.  I would easily recommend checking it out if you typically develop <em>for</em> *nix based systems as it can make setting up a local dev environment pretty nice and easy to manage.  Not only that, but you can then share the dev environment with other developers on your team which is great news for folks that play well with others.</p>

<p>You will probably find it to be a bit of a "slow down in order to speed up" routine.  I had previously played with it a little so I was able to dive in pretty fast this time around and found it pretty straight forward after having wrapped my head around it the first time several weeks back.</p>

<p>I originally found out about it by reading the article "<a href="http://phpadvent.org/2011/facilitating-development-environment-consistency-by-jeff-loiselle">Facilitating Development Environment Consistency</a>" over on the <a href="http://phpadvent.org">PHP advent</a> site.  So that might be a good place for you to start if you're interested in the approach.</p>

<p>If you're not already subscribed to PHP Advent or following them on Twitter, I'd highly recommend it.  New articles only come in December of each year but some of them can be pretty stellar.</p>]]></description>
