			<h1>Simple RESTful Storage</h1>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/mwalters/SimpleRestfulStorage" target="_blank">View on Github</a></p>
			
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>This is still VERY much a work in progress.  The very high-level idea is to have a RESTful API that can be interacted with to Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete objects while supporting revisions.  This system makes use of <a href="http://codeigniter.com/" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a>.</p>

			<h3>What It Does</h3>
			<p>Currently, the service supports CRUD with single items (can be strings, objects, arrays, etc).  It supports revisions of objects stored.</p>

			<h3>What&#146;s Left To Do</h3>
			<p>This could be a very long list.  For the immediate future I see this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Add support for &#147;Collections&#148; of Items.  Revision history should be kept for the entire collection as well as a specific item within the collection.</li>
				<li>Add support for different storage mechanisms that could be switched between based on configuration.  Currently Disk is supported.  But I&#146;d like to offer support for database and in-memory database backed systems.</li>
				<li>Look at adding Utility plugin-ins for the system.  Example: Allow a custom header to be passed with a GET request in order to have 3 separate objects concatenated and returned.  Think in terms of &#8230; if say 3 CSS files were stored in the system, a request could be made by a front-end server to have the 3 CSS files concatenated and minified.  This is a simple example, but I think a plugin architecture like this that allowed for special headers and different behavior based on them could be quite powerful.</li>
			</ul>
