					<div class="post-meta">
						Posted <a href="/2008/12/23/2008-year-in-review.html
">December 23rd, 2008</a>
						 in <a href="/category/personal-0.html">Personal</a>					</div>
					<div class="post-content"><p>The year is coming to an end, and friends and family keep sending me letters saying what's been up with them this year.  Just tonight I received an email from a friend and they said they had opted to go electronic this year for their letter.  That sounded like a pretty good idea.  I've never written one of these, but I figure my blog is a good platform for it, however I will ask that you bear with me since it's my first time with one of these :)</p>

<p>The beginning of the year was somewhat turbulent for me.  It was riddled with sickness and general unpleasantness.  It all started with <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/01/24/wisdom-teeth-are-out-and-i-kinda-regret-it/">having my wisdom teeth removed</a>.  Unfortunately something went wrong in the procedure, and the result was the front portion of my lower jaw/lip was left numb.  Luckily feeling slowly started returning to it, and now there's only a very small part that isn't 100%.  I'm starting to think that's permanent, but at least it's not annoying.  Within a week after that, I came down with a cold, and then shortly after that, the flu, or something equally bad.  Needless to say, January/February pretty much sucked.</p>

<p>I wish I could say that was the end of the bad news.  Shortly after that, I ended up finding myself on the way to Mississippi because my Grandfather passed away.  Then, my employer at the time, started having lay-off's.  Unfortunately some people I had grown pretty close to found themselves without a job.</p>

<p>Luckily, things started turning around about mid-year.  I moved into a townhouse (more space!).  Most (all?) of my friends seem to be doing great on the job-front (never doubted that they'd turn out any different) and I've managed to stay fairly close with most of them.  Also, in July, I accepted a position with a new company (Business Bullpen), still doing Web Development.  So far it's been pretty fun.  I'm getting to work on some pretty mind-blowing high profile websites, and I got to move towards developing more heavily with WordPress on some other sites.  Graham and Todd are fun to work with, and I'd probably say I feel more "at home" with this job then any other I've ever had.  That's not just because I get to work from home a lot either ;)</p>

<p>Towards the end of this year I've found myself commuting to Charlottesville twice a week, and probably getting too addicted to TV shows -- True Blood, Entourage, Heroes, House, The Office, 30 Rock, Stargate Atlantis (which is letting me down for its series finale), and some others here and there.</p>

<p>So even though 2008 started off more rocky then I would have liked, at least it finally picked up and things look good for 2009 (knock on wood).  I hope to continue with my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/tag/pic-of-the-day/">Picture of the Day Series</a>, try to get better at staying connected with friends, and keep moving forward.</p></div>
