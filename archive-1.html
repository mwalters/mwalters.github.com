<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I don't understand why companies think they should be allowed to ETF my checking acct when they won't let me do the same to theirs</p>&mdash; Matt Walters (@mwalters) <a href="https://twitter.com/mwalters/status/177773804632813568" data-datetime="2012-03-08T15:12:32+00:00">March 8, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I think it's pretty obvious why a company would want this from their perspective.  Many Americans keep their mortgage payment, car payment, etc… in their checking account.  It's sort of the purpose for the account after all and they know the consumer will try to keep the account padded.  So companies want access because they know it's one of their best chances at getting cash from you reliably.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120308-kbh9ibyh7ambhfbse1qs7kir9x.jpg" align="left" alt="Cash Wallet" style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" />I say giving a company access to auto-draft your checking account is tantamount to opening your wallet toward them and saying, "here, take what you need."  </p>

<p>The very reasons that companies want this sort of unfettered access to your money are the same exact reasons that you should be protecting it like it's your own personal Fort Knox.</p>

<p>What if the company has a billing error?  Who hasn't experienced that before?  With access to your checking account it could leave you strapped to pay other bills.  By the time you deal with their over-sea's billing department or whatever absurd processes they have in place, it could take a long period of time to get things straightened out.</p>

<p>I'm not saying all automatic recurring payments are bad.  But if you want to bill me like that, have a credit card payment as an option.  I understand it means you have to pay processing fees, but honestly, I don't care.</p>

<p>At least then the consumer has a buffer between their checking account and the company.  As a consumer it's good too because your credit card company should be someone you can at least reason with if you have a record of being responsible with them, and they might even go to bat with the other company if you need them to and you can prove that it was an error on the part of the billing party.  Worst case, you have the option to pay off the credit card over time and not have it impact your personal cash flow as seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a somewhat cautionary tail</strong></p>

<p>Once I had a DSL provider (Verizon) charge me for 2 months service when connecting me.  This wasn't standard.  It was an <strong>admitted</strong> error on the part of their billing department.  Straigtening it out involved me having to talk to someone in another country, and the best they could offer me was putting it as a credit toward my future service.  They absolutely refused to reverse all or part of the transaction to put my cash back in my account and there was nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>Luckily this was just a low dollar DSL service payment.  But what if it was something larger?  Or what if they'd billed me for a years worth of service?  Mistakes happen at large companies, and leaving the consumer holding the bag over a company error is horrible.</p>

<p>This happened years ago.  But I learned my lesson and I urge you to learn from it too.  Outside of extraordinary circumstances, stop letting companies have such easy access to your cash.</p></div>

<p>My desk is a simple Ikea desk and I have a Dell 24-inch monitor set up.  I try to keep it pretty minimal.  I used my iPhone to take the picture so you can't see it with the handset to the left of my keyboard, but here's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FMVCRU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mattwaltersne-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003FMVCRU">product on Amazon</a>.  The laptop is a 13-inch MacBook Air.  I also have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125XBHG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mattwaltersne-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00125XBHG">Mirra Chair by Herman Miller</a>.</p>

<p>The picture doesn't show it but hanging from the back of the desk is a cable organizer (also from Ikea) that keeps all of my cords mostly out of my way except for where they drop down for power on the lower left.</p>

<p>Note: don't ask me why the cat (Sprocket) likes to sleep in the dog crate.  It doesn't make sense to me either.</p></div>

<p><a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting">Interpreted Languages: PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby</a>: Interesting (for me) to see this all side by side.  I really need to invest in learning Ruby and/or Python one of these days.  I've long wanted to dive into Python but I find myself encountering Ruby or wanting to use things I find that are in Ruby more often, so it will probably win in terms of what I dive into next.  I've been putting off Ruby too long now anyhow.</p>

<p><a href="http://vagrantbox.es/44/">ubuntu 11.04 server amd64 (with puppet support)</a>: As you may remember, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2012/vagrant-and-puppet-are-pretty-fun.html">I have been getting into Vagrant &amp; Puppet</a> lately.  Earlier this week I ran into a problem where the Lucid base image had a bad link between PHP and PCRE.  The easiest way I could figure out to solve this was to get a newer version of Ubuntu.  Just when I thought I was going to need to make a new image for myself I stumbled across this image on <a href="http://vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a>.</p>

I used unDock, Palua, and Perian.  I can see others on the list as helpful as well.  I will note though that I tried RestoreMeNot and had issues with it slowing things down when I was tabbing between applications.  Not sure why this was, but as soon as I uninstalled it things went back to being snappy.</p>
