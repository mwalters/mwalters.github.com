<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I don't understand why companies think they should be allowed to ETF my checking acct when they won't let me do the same to theirs</p>&mdash; Matt Walters (@mwalters) <a href="https://twitter.com/mwalters/status/177773804632813568" data-datetime="2012-03-08T15:12:32+00:00">March 8, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I think it's pretty obvious why a company would want this from their perspective.  Many Americans keep their mortgage payment, car payment, etcâ€¦ in their checking account.  It's sort of the purpose for the account after all and they know the consumer will try to keep the account padded.  So companies want access because they know it's one of their best chances at getting cash from you reliably.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120308-kbh9ibyh7ambhfbse1qs7kir9x.jpg" align="left" alt="Cash Wallet" style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" />I say giving a company access to auto-draft your checking account is tantamount to opening your wallet toward them and saying, "here, take what you need."  </p>

<p>The very reasons that companies want this sort of unfettered access to your money are the same exact reasons that you should be protecting it like it's your own personal Fort Knox.</p>

<p>What if the company has a billing error?  Who hasn't experienced that before?  With access to your checking account it could leave you strapped to pay other bills.  By the time you deal with their over-sea's billing department or whatever absurd processes they have in place, it could take a long period of time to get things straightened out.</p>

<p>I'm not saying all automatic recurring payments are bad.  But if you want to bill me like that, have a credit card payment as an option.  I understand it means you have to pay processing fees, but honestly, I don't care.</p>

<p>At least then the consumer has a buffer between their checking account and the company.  As a consumer it's good too because your credit card company should be someone you can at least reason with if you have a record of being responsible with them, and they might even go to bat with the other company if you need them to and you can prove that it was an error on the part of the billing party.  Worst case, you have the option to pay off the credit card over time and not have it impact your personal cash flow as seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a somewhat cautionary tail</strong></p>

<p>Once I had a DSL provider (Verizon) charge me for 2 months service when connecting me.  This wasn't standard.  It was an <strong>admitted</strong> error on the part of their billing department.  Straigtening it out involved me having to talk to someone in another country, and the best they could offer me was putting it as a credit toward my future service.  They absolutely refused to reverse all or part of the transaction to put my cash back in my account and there was nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>Luckily this was just a low dollar DSL service payment.  But what if it was something larger?  Or what if they'd billed me for a years worth of service?  Mistakes happen at large companies, and leaving the consumer holding the bag over a company error is horrible.</p>

<p>This happened years ago.  But I learned my lesson and I urge you to learn from it too.  Outside of extraordinary circumstances, stop letting companies have such easy access to your cash.</p></div>

<p>My desk is a simple Ikea desk and I have a Dell 24-inch monitor set up.  I try to keep it pretty minimal.  I used my iPhone to take the picture so you can't see it with the handset to the left of my keyboard, but here's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FMVCRU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mattwaltersne-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003FMVCRU">product on Amazon</a>.  The laptop is a 13-inch MacBook Air.  I also have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125XBHG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mattwaltersne-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00125XBHG">Mirra Chair by Herman Miller</a>.</p>

<p>The picture doesn't show it but hanging from the back of the desk is a cable organizer (also from Ikea) that keeps all of my cords mostly out of my way except for where they drop down for power on the lower left.</p>

<p>Note: don't ask me why the cat (Sprocket) likes to sleep in the dog crate.  It doesn't make sense to me either.</p></div>

<p><a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting">Interpreted Languages: PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby</a>: Interesting (for me) to see this all side by side.  I really need to invest in learning Ruby and/or Python one of these days.  I've long wanted to dive into Python but I find myself encountering Ruby or wanting to use things I find that are in Ruby more often, so it will probably win in terms of what I dive into next.  I've been putting off Ruby too long now anyhow.</p>

Earlier this week I ran into a problem where the Lucid base image had a bad link between PHP and PCRE.  The easiest way I could figure out to solve this was to get a newer version of Ubuntu.  Just when I thought I was going to need to make a new image for myself I stumbled across this image on <a href="http://vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a>.</p>

		Posted <a href="/2012/02/22/potluck-php-framework.html
">February 22nd, 2012</a>
		 in <a href="/category/development-0.html">Development</a>	</div>
	<div class="post-content"><p>In my free time I've been playing around with some different tools for development and I've sort of come up with a Potluck PHP Framework of sorts.  It's actually not bad and stays pretty lightweight while giving some decent functionality.  Keep in mind, I've not spent extensive time with this setup, but I am liking what I'm encountering so far.  Here's what I've pieced together:</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a>: PHP5 Micro Framework</h3>

<p>It's pretty lightweight and you're not going to find tons of functionality built into it.  But don't let it fool you.  It is pretty easy to extend or build upon and has some important pieces of functionality that a framework should have already built in.</p>

<p>My only "beef" with Slim is probably that it doesn't give a great Controller structure if you're going to take an MVC approach to things.  But I'm still just starting to play with the framework so I might find a way to build in something more like what I'm expecting.  I typically like the CodeIgniter approach on controllers/routes.  I'd like to see if I can figure out a way to minimally recreate that functionality so I can make a new route just by dropping a file/class/method into the appropriate place(s).  For a small site this would be a non-issue anyhow.</p>

<h3><a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>: Template Engine</h3>

<p>This is rather <a href="https://github.com/codeguy/Slim-Extras/blob/master/Views/TwigView.php">easily integrated</a> into Slim and gives you a nice template engine for your views.  I'm typically not a fan of mustache templating systems but Twig is a pretty robust engine.  In my playing around with it, I am finding myself willing to deal with the mustaches in order to gain the advantages Twig is providing.</p>

<h3><a href="http://phpdatamapper.com/">phpDataMapper</a></h3>

<p>phpDataMapper is more or less a port of the <a href="http://datamapper.org/">Ruby DataMapper</a> project.  This is the one I've had the least time spent with of the 3 items on this list.  But I definitely enjoy not having to worry about escaping things for the database, etc., and being able to quickly establish a database back end for the app I'm using this setup with.  I went from no database connection to pulling data out and displaying it on my page in about 5 minutes with phpDataMapper.</p>

<hr />

<p>Could I have done all of this with something like CodeIgniter?  Sure.  I'm a big fan of CodeIgniter so I'm not making this list as an argument against CI or other PHP frameworks.  I will say that I was able to integrate Slim, Twig, and phpDataMapper in about 15 minutes of Googling and typing.</p>

<p>One advantage I could see to using a setup like this is that you get to very explicitly choose where you want to put weight into the framework you're piecing together for your application.  I'm not sure how light-weight Twig and phpDataMapper would be considered, but Slim is definitely light-weight.  Database interactions and rendering are areas that I was ok with adding weight to the application for because of what they provide me.</p></div>
