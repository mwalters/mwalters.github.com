<p>After last weeks Amazon Web Services (AWS) issues, everyone is talking a lot about "The Cloud" and whether it's the right answer for many companies.  I'm a pretty big fan of virtual servers, but I can't say that they are for everyone.  When designing any sort of environment I would say there are some, what should seem simple, ideas to keep in mind:  <!--more--></p>

<h3>Know your uptime requirements:</h3>

<p>Can your business/website withstand being down for 6-12 hours?  I would say most can, probably far more than think they could.  Some organizations over architect their environments because brief amounts of downtime are unpalatable to them when the simple fact is their users will forgive temporary downtime as long as it doesn't become the norm.  Regardless, your organization needs to figure out what your uptime requirements are and architect to those requirements.  If you need extreme amounts of uptime then you need servers/services spread across multiple availability zones if you're with a single provider, and you possibly need to have services in place across multiple providers so you can recover as quickly as possible if something does go wrong.  How far you need to take this will all be determined by your requirements and help you create your Plan B for when things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<h3>Have a Plan B:</h3>

<p>Once you have your uptime requirements in place, you can start formulating a Plan B.  This might include using your load balancer to point at a different availability zone, or it might mean quick DNS changes to point your site to a back-up provider.  Short of that though you need to test failures at a lower level.  What if just one of your UI servers dies, what happens?  Hopefully your application can easily sustain something like this and requests quickly re-route to another server.  Similarly, hopefully the services that your UI servers talk to can easily handle single failures like this.</p>

<h3>Test your Plan B:</h3>

<p><strong>This is important.</strong>  Make sure that things behave how you expect them to.  Shut down one of your UI servers, or your back-end services.  Do things react how you planned?  If not, then fix it so that they do.  What you do not want to have happen is you end up in a situation where your server has failed and brought your site down or your provider starts having cascading failures and you are at the mercy of their email support.  If your plan does all work as planned then great!  Test it periodically and fix things when they come up (you will need to make corrections to your plan as your service grows!), then you can rest easier at night.</p>

<p>At this point you might find yourself wondering about cost, complexity, etc.  I saw a tweet recently that I related to these thoughts:</p>

<p>http://twitter.com/#!/kylecordes/status/61540471767449601</p>

<p>I'm not sure of his exact meaning here but how I interpreted it brings me back to my first point, knowing your requirements.  The cloud is not necessarily inexpensive and is often more complex then having a simpler set up with a dedicated server or two hosted with your favorite provider.  Design for your needs at the time and adapt as they change over time.  You might be just fine hosting in a small environment and keeping good backups that you can restore to another server and/or provider if needed.</p>

<p>You are keeping backups of your data, aren't you?</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Another year is coming to an end today and I'm finally getting around to writing this post, the third in my series of <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">year end reviews</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long and eventful year.  Maybe it would be best to update based on the different parts of my life.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I started off the year working as a contractor at <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">WordPress HelpCenter</a>.  It was a great experience and even though I have now left WPHC, I still think very highly of the company and Alex King, its founder.  In the beginning of the year, I was the lead for the team.  I grew a lot as a developer, a sales person, and as a customer service rep.  It was a fast paced environment, likely the most fast paced I've ever worked in.  Towards the end of Fall I was presented with a new opportunity to work on-site with a local company, <a href="http://www.snagajob.com/">SnagAJob</a>.</p>

<p>So far SnagAJob has been great.  I'm continuing to grow as a developer and am still able to work with WordPress and PHP (my areas of expertise).  I am really enjoying getting to know the folks I work with and am finally getting around to trying Test Driven Develoment with Unit Tests.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>You may remember me having <a href="/2009/12/27/2009-year-end-review/">mentioned Carrie last year</a>.  We moved in together around May and have been traveling a good bit this year.  We've been to Phoenix AZ, Boulder CO, Baltimore MD, Las Vegas NV, and New York NY.  That's probably more traveling then I've done in the past five years combined and also represents the furthest West I've ever traveled.  We had a lot of good times and eventually I'm going to get around to posting some of the pictures we've taken on this website.  Around our one year anniversary, I decided to ask her to marry me and, amazingly, she said yes.</p>

<p>We're working on plans for the wedding and have booked a venue and set a date, October 8th 2011.  We've started a <a href="http://mattpluscarrie.com/">website</a> to let folks know what we're up to with plans and "us" in general.</p>

<h3>Hobby</h3>

<p>I haven't been as active with my photography as I have been in the past.  This might seem odd given all the travel we've done this year, but I've been trying to focus a little more on living/enjoying the experience rather then trying to document it with my camera and missing what it is I'm photographing.</p>

<p>I've been continuing to work with WordPress a lot both in my work and free time.  I assisted in organizing WordCamp 2010 again this year.  This time around I was mainly acting as a "care-taker" of the event.  All thanks and recognition should go to Carrie &amp; Hunter at <a href="http://studiosavvydesign.com/">studioSavvy</a>, and Andrew of <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/">Your Search Advisor</a>.  They took care of working out the schedule, locating sponsors, etc.  I'd say it was even more successful then last year and that's entirely thanks to the three of them.</p>

<p>I think that pretty much covers some of the larger highlights of the year and let's you know where I am.  Let's hope all goes well in 2011 :)</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Following on the heels of my post of <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2010/08/24/five-must-have-tools/">Five of my must-have tools</a>, I thought I'd share this list of services that might be valuable to others that have started their own at-home business.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4677" title="harvest_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> is a service for tracking time, expenses, and invoicing your clients.  I find it very easy to use and manage due to its straight-forward interface and tools such as the <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/widget">Dashboard Widget</a> and <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/features/iphone">iPhone application</a>help with keeping track of my time.  The emails sent to clients are customizable and the invoices look professional with the option to include your logo.  It also supports partial payment of invoices as well as invoicing services and products.  If that's not enough, you can also define different hourly rates for different people, or different projects, or even different types of tasks.  Plus, you can give log-in credentials to contractors so that they can track their time in your system, making it easier for you to invoice the clients.  If you like PayPal, it even has invoice payment integration with PayPal and automatically marks invoices paid when payment is received via PayPal.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4679" title="googleapps" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg" alt="" width="85" height="83" /></a><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for Domains Standard</a> is a great, free, solution for your e-mail, calendar and document management.  Web mail allows you to use your email from any computer, and IMAP access allows you synchronized read status across your multiple devices (computer, phone, etc assuming all your devices support IMAP).  The calendar program is feature rich and helps you keep on top of scheduled events.  Google Docs is an easy way to create and read simple documents is basically any format.  Though for more complex things you might still find yourself wanting a more robust editor.  The great thing about the Standard edition is that it is free for up to 50 users so you can stick with it if you decide to grow your company, and with things like Sites (Google Apps version of a Wiki) you'll have a place to share documentation for policies/procedures/etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4680" title="icon_ringcentral_bigger" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png" alt="" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/">RingCentral</a> can work quite nicely for your phone needs.  Whether you want to sign up for it and just send calls to your cell phone, or if you want to buy an IP Phone to have a nice desk phone that calls ring into.  I use an IP Phone with my account and have had no problems at all other than my internet connection going down.  But in a previous job we used it and routed calls to our cell phones which worked well too.  You can define different call rules for different hours of the day so that during nights/weekends calls go straight to voicemail, but during normal hours your calls will be routed to your cell or IP phone.  It costs a little money, but can be nice and is another service that can grow with you if you decide to grow your business including features like auto-attendants, "office" extensions (though you don't all need to be in the same place), etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4681" title="rtmdesktop_128x128" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> is a simple task management system with some surprisingly powerful features.  This is a recent re-entry into my work-flow.  I like the ability to create different lists, whether it's a grocery list, or keeping track of follow-up calls/estimates/quotes that I need to send out for work.  They make the data entry as painless as possible and then you can setup things like iCal feeds to have tasks show up on your calendar.  There is also a pretty decent iPhone app available to Pro customers that let you take your to-do list with you to keep up with things.  I also have used this in a previous position and the ability to let team members send you tasks via email that are then added to your to-do list can be nice to have if working with multiple folks.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4682" title="campfire_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> is an online chat room for teams to collaborate and keep up with each other.  Admittedly, this one is a bit of a stretch for a small at-home business but we all need to collaborate with others on projects from time to time and if you're working from home, this might be the perfect solution.  For free, Campfire offers you a chat room with up to 4 simultaneous chatters and up to 10MB of space for uploaded files.  It can be a quick way to chat with multiple folks about a project and share images.  It could even serve as the virtual water cooler if you're working with other folks in different geographic areas or if you just want to invite some friends into it to fight off the lack of social interaction from working at home :)</p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4683" title="fluid_icon2" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://cotweet.com/">CoTweet</a> -- This one is definitely more team focused.  If you have several folks on your team and you're interacting with Twitter then I would consider this to be a must-have for your team.  It allows you to receive email alerts when someone sends a @reply to your twitter account and allows you all to be logged into the same Twitter account at once and see conversations your account has had with users before you respond to them.  If someone else on the team has already responded to someone, you wouldn't want to send a second response from the same account, would you? :)</p>

<p>What would be on your list?  I'm always looking for a better mouse trap.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>In the recent past I've started gathering some pretty useful tools / programs to simplify my life and help me streamline my work flows.  I wanted to share some of them in case others might find them interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4609" title="textexpander_iphone" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png" alt="" width="60" height="58" /></a><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> - This is a recent addition to my toolkit and I am finding it nearly endlessly helpful.  From coding snippets to canned email responses, it is speeding up my work.  I work in a helpdesk situation of sorts and this allows me to quickly piece together emails from verbiage that we commonly use.  On the coding side of things it helps me out by allowing me to not remember the .htaccess syntax for increasing PHP's memory limit, or turning on error reporting and display_errors.  Complex code snippets are saved for a program I'll mention in a moment, but I'm finding uses for TextExpander all over the place.  Also helpful is its ability to sync snippets across Dropbox.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4611" title="TextMate_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png" alt="" width="61" height="61" /></a><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - The Missing Editor for Mac OS X.  That's a fairly accurate description in my opinion.  It is a panacea for nearly all your editing needs.  I use it for coding (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, etc) as well as working with SQL files.  It has features such as Subversion integration via Bundles.  Also available -- <a href="http://github.com/Gipetto/wordpress.tmbundle">WordPress Bundle</a>,  Markdown, and much more via bundles.  Having syntax highlighting available for basically any coding language I could open is extremely helpful, and if you can get accustomed to working with plain text files, something like this will work great for you.  Given the amount of WordPress work I do these days, I love having the WordPress bundle available.  Creating things like Widgets are basically a 5 minute operation for a simple widget now.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4612" title="evernote_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></a><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> - Great tool for working with notes, remembering things, and having easy access across devices (I have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Mac Mini).  This is an easy solution for keeping my notes available to me no matter what device I have handy.  It seems to fit the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS Principle</a>".  Need to make a to-do list?  No problem, create a bulleted list and add a checkbox at the beginning of each line so you can easily track what has been done and what needs doing.  But I can also keep pictures available there if needed, along with notes about them.  It also lets me break my notes up into notebooks so I can more easily separate my work items from my personal items.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4614" title="dropbox_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png" alt="" width="59" height="59" /></a><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - This is a fantastic, yet simple little utility I've grown to love over the past couple of months.  More often, I am switching between my laptop and desktop computers.  Since I typically store many things I might need on my dropbox, I can easily keep working on whatever is at hand.  I have also been using it to share items with friends and coworkers.  I get asked why I used Dropbox from time to time by folks in an effort, I believe, for me to convince them why they should use it.  I usually don't bite on this though.  I think some folks have a use for it (such as folks that have several devices/computers and want an easy way to have files available to all of them) and some folks don't.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4615" title="1PasswordLogo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg" alt="" width="57" height="57" /></a><a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> - If you haven't come across this one yet, you should definitely go check it out and try it.  I have so many passwords these days, it's nearly impossible to keep up with them.  However with 1Password I'm able to use a simple hotkey when sitting at a log in form and it instantly enters the correct username and password for me and submits the form.  It even includes some anti-phishing protection to help prevent you from entering your username and password on a site pretending to be one of your common sites.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many other tools I enjoy using, but these 5 have quickly integrated themselves into how I work and I think if I lost any of them I would be quickly looking for some form of replacement.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Last year I started a <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">series of Year End Review posts</a>.  I figured it would be good to continue it this year as so much has happened in my life in 2009, that it's likely not many people know where or what I'm doing any longer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the year started off poorly.  Early in the year, as the economy tanked, I came really close to losing my job.  The guys I was working for fought long and hard though and were able to keep pulling in enough business to allow me to stay on which I greatly appreciated.  Around this same time, I thought it might be good to start cultivating other opportunities if I needed them.  I took a look at the things I was doing and what I really enjoyed, and thought about how to start making that be able to support me.</p>

<p>Early in the year, I announced that I would be organizing <a href="http://wordcamprichmond.org/">WordCamp Richmond</a>.  It is an all day event where folks get together and discuss all things related to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, the powerful blogging and Content Management System for websites.  It also helped me to get my name out there in the local area to let folks know that I was around and could help them work with this tool.  Anyhow, the event came and went, and was a great success.  We had more attendee's then I thought we would, the speakers all performed amazingly, and we're already planning another again in 2010.</p>

<p>Not too long after WordCamp I purchased a new-to-me car, a 2006 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157619443567630/">Subaru Outback</a>, LL Bean.  It's been doing great and really helped out with all the snow we got a week or two back.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157611702737938/">Atticus</a> enjoys riding around in the back and it's an extremely comfortable car to ride around in.</p>

<p>Let's not forget that I also met and started dating Carrie this year :)  We get along great and have spent a lot of time together the past couple of weeks.  Atticus approves of her, so you know she's good stuff.  She attended WordCamp and at some point after it we started talking, and then talking some more, and eventually I worked up the nerve to ask her out and she said yes.  Things have been great ever since.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Summer, I switched jobs to become a contractor at Capital One.  This was my second time back and I enjoyed it, however my stay was brief.  In November, I began speaking with a friend in Denver, CO about a new opportunity.  The new opportunity involves me managing and staffing a <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">help center for WordPress</a>.  Individuals can call or email us, and receive professional support for their sites/themes/plugins at reasonable prices.  I started work on December 7th and so far things are going great.</p>

<p>So it has been a bumpy year, switching jobs, meeting new folks, starting my business, and many other things.  Even though is seems the year flew by, I'm not sure I can say it was because I was having so much fun.  I'm just hoping that some of what I accomplished this year is going to let me have more fun in the coming years.</p></div>
