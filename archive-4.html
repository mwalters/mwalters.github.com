<p>I find myself surprisingly saddened about the death of Steve Jobs. I feel sort of hokey saying that, but the main reason I feel sad is that he didn't get more time to spend with his family after leaving Apple.</p>

<p>I thank him greatly for his contributions to the things I enjoy in my everyday life but I'd gladly give it all up if he could have another day with his family.</p>

<p>He'll be greatly missed.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>I have had programming language debates in the past.  I've recently been having similar discussions and realized some things.  Arguing one language against another is a religious debate that will never be won.  I realized it wasn't about #winning.  It would be more valuable to change the discussion to why I chose PHP and continue developing with it to this day.<!--more--></p>

<p>Total disclosure, one of the key reasons I chose PHP originally was because it was easy to find an inexpensive web host that supported it.  In fact the web host I was using at the time already supported it.  I didn't have to worry about licensing fee's, there were many hosts supporting it, and I was already using web applications built on it.  Those are pretty simple reasons, and certainly reasons that could have changed over time.  For instance, unlike when I was 20 and learning PHP, these days I could afford the licensing fee's if I chose to.  The key thing that has kept me with PHP is the documentation and community.</p>

<p>The documentation for PHP itself is unrivaled with other languages from what I've seen.  PHP.net is a fantastic learning resource and was a huge help when I was getting started.  I could easily browse available functions, and didn't need to search across tons of blogs for likely out of date information.  If I needed to sort an array I could look up sort() and as well as providing me the syntax/parameters, at the bottom of the page it would list other array sorting functions which I could check to see if they better met my needs based on what I was doing in my application.  This matured documentation also exists in other places within PHP.  For example in WordPress, the documentation is fairly strong.  It's not always completely up to date, but the fact it's as comprehensive as it is places it head and shoulders above many other open source programs.</p>

<p>The community is definitely the key feature for me with PHP.  I find it both welcoming and accepting of various skill levels.  I find folks in the PHP community commonly focus on getting stuff done and eagerly teach and share with each other.  There's not much meaningless focus on academic debates or pontificating to boost one's own ego.  That's not to say those things never happens in the PHP community, but I find it happening less often in the world of PHP.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why lots of folks like to consider PHP the red-headed stepchild of web development, but they do.  When developers of other languages do start attacking PHP or my use of it, they're usually just reminding me of why I like my choice of PHP in the first place.  It would probably be a more meaningful discussion for all of us if they'd instead try to show me why they chose their preferred language instead of trying to compare it feature for feature with PHP and simply answering my questions while respectfully understanding if I don't agree about whether I should be using their preferred language.</p></div>

<p>After last weeks Amazon Web Services (AWS) issues, everyone is talking a lot about "The Cloud" and whether it's the right answer for many companies.  I'm a pretty big fan of virtual servers, but I can't say that they are for everyone.  When designing any sort of environment I would say there are some, what should seem simple, ideas to keep in mind:  <!--more--></p>

<h3>Know your uptime requirements:</h3>

<p>Can your business/website withstand being down for 6-12 hours?  I would say most can, probably far more than think they could.  Some organizations over architect their environments because brief amounts of downtime are unpalatable to them when the simple fact is their users will forgive temporary downtime as long as it doesn't become the norm.  Regardless, your organization needs to figure out what your uptime requirements are and architect to those requirements.  If you need extreme amounts of uptime then you need servers/services spread across multiple availability zones if you're with a single provider, and you possibly need to have services in place across multiple providers so you can recover as quickly as possible if something does go wrong.  How far you need to take this will all be determined by your requirements and help you create your Plan B for when things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<h3>Have a Plan B:</h3>

<p>Once you have your uptime requirements in place, you can start formulating a Plan B.  This might include using your load balancer to point at a different availability zone, or it might mean quick DNS changes to point your site to a back-up provider.  Short of that though you need to test failures at a lower level.  What if just one of your UI servers dies, what happens?  Hopefully your application can easily sustain something like this and requests quickly re-route to another server.  Similarly, hopefully the services that your UI servers talk to can easily handle single failures like this.</p>

<h3>Test your Plan B:</h3>

<p><strong>This is important.</strong>  Make sure that things behave how you expect them to.  Shut down one of your UI servers, or your back-end services.  Do things react how you planned?  If not, then fix it so that they do.  What you do not want to have happen is you end up in a situation where your server has failed and brought your site down or your provider starts having cascading failures and you are at the mercy of their email support.  If your plan does all work as planned then great!  Test it periodically and fix things when they come up (you will need to make corrections to your plan as your service grows!), then you can rest easier at night.</p>

<p>At this point you might find yourself wondering about cost, complexity, etc.  I saw a tweet recently that I related to these thoughts:</p>

<p>http://twitter.com/#!/kylecordes/status/61540471767449601</p>

<p>I'm not sure of his exact meaning here but how I interpreted it brings me back to my first point, knowing your requirements.  The cloud is not necessarily inexpensive and is often more complex then having a simpler set up with a dedicated server or two hosted with your favorite provider.  Design for your needs at the time and adapt as they change over time.  You might be just fine hosting in a small environment and keeping good backups that you can restore to another server and/or provider if needed.</p>

<p>You are keeping backups of your data, aren't you?</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Another year is coming to an end today and I'm finally getting around to writing this post, the third in my series of <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">year end reviews</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long and eventful year.  Maybe it would be best to update based on the different parts of my life.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I started off the year working as a contractor at <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">WordPress HelpCenter</a>.  It was a great experience and even though I have now left WPHC, I still think very highly of the company and Alex King, its founder.  In the beginning of the year, I was the lead for the team.  I grew a lot as a developer, a sales person, and as a customer service rep.  It was a fast paced environment, likely the most fast paced I've ever worked in.  Towards the end of Fall I was presented with a new opportunity to work on-site with a local company, <a href="http://www.snagajob.com/">SnagAJob</a>.</p>

<p>So far SnagAJob has been great.  I'm continuing to grow as a developer and am still able to work with WordPress and PHP (my areas of expertise).  I am really enjoying getting to know the folks I work with and am finally getting around to trying Test Driven Develoment with Unit Tests.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>You may remember me having <a href="/2009/12/27/2009-year-end-review/">mentioned Carrie last year</a>.  We moved in together around May and have been traveling a good bit this year.  We've been to Phoenix AZ, Boulder CO, Baltimore MD, Las Vegas NV, and New York NY.  That's probably more traveling then I've done in the past five years combined and also represents the furthest West I've ever traveled.  We had a lot of good times and eventually I'm going to get around to posting some of the pictures we've taken on this website.  Around our one year anniversary, I decided to ask her to marry me and, amazingly, she said yes.</p>

<p>We're working on plans for the wedding and have booked a venue and set a date, October 8th 2011.  We've started a <a href="http://mattpluscarrie.com/">website</a> to let folks know what we're up to with plans and "us" in general.</p>

<h3>Hobby</h3>

<p>I haven't been as active with my photography as I have been in the past.  This might seem odd given all the travel we've done this year, but I've been trying to focus a little more on living/enjoying the experience rather then trying to document it with my camera and missing what it is I'm photographing.</p>

<p>I've been continuing to work with WordPress a lot both in my work and free time.  I assisted in organizing WordCamp 2010 again this year.  This time around I was mainly acting as a "care-taker" of the event.  All thanks and recognition should go to Carrie &amp; Hunter at <a href="http://studiosavvydesign.com/">studioSavvy</a>, and Andrew of <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/">Your Search Advisor</a>.  They took care of working out the schedule, locating sponsors, etc.  I'd say it was even more successful then last year and that's entirely thanks to the three of them.</p>

<p>I think that pretty much covers some of the larger highlights of the year and let's you know where I am.  Let's hope all goes well in 2011 :)</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Following on the heels of my post of <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2010/08/24/five-must-have-tools/">Five of my must-have tools</a>, I thought I'd share this list of services that might be valuable to others that have started their own at-home business.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4677" title="harvest_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> is a service for tracking time, expenses, and invoicing your clients.  I find it very easy to use and manage due to its straight-forward interface and tools such as the <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/widget">Dashboard Widget</a> and <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/features/iphone">iPhone application</a>help with keeping track of my time.  The emails sent to clients are customizable and the invoices look professional with the option to include your logo.  It also supports partial payment of invoices as well as invoicing services and products.  If that's not enough, you can also define different hourly rates for different people, or different projects, or even different types of tasks.  Plus, you can give log-in credentials to contractors so that they can track their time in your system, making it easier for you to invoice the clients.  If you like PayPal, it even has invoice payment integration with PayPal and automatically marks invoices paid when payment is received via PayPal.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4679" title="googleapps" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg" alt="" width="85" height="83" /></a><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for Domains Standard</a> is a great, free, solution for your e-mail, calendar and document management.  Web mail allows you to use your email from any computer, and IMAP access allows you synchronized read status across your multiple devices (computer, phone, etc assuming all your devices support IMAP).  The calendar program is feature rich and helps you keep on top of scheduled events.  Google Docs is an easy way to create and read simple documents is basically any format.  Though for more complex things you might still find yourself wanting a more robust editor.  The great thing about the Standard edition is that it is free for up to 50 users so you can stick with it if you decide to grow your company, and with things like Sites (Google Apps version of a Wiki) you'll have a place to share documentation for policies/procedures/etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4680" title="icon_ringcentral_bigger" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png" alt="" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/">RingCentral</a> can work quite nicely for your phone needs.  Whether you want to sign up for it and just send calls to your cell phone, or if you want to buy an IP Phone to have a nice desk phone that calls ring into.  I use an IP Phone with my account and have had no problems at all other than my internet connection going down.  But in a previous job we used it and routed calls to our cell phones which worked well too.  You can define different call rules for different hours of the day so that during nights/weekends calls go straight to voicemail, but during normal hours your calls will be routed to your cell or IP phone.  It costs a little money, but can be nice and is another service that can grow with you if you decide to grow your business including features like auto-attendants, "office" extensions (though you don't all need to be in the same place), etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4681" title="rtmdesktop_128x128" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> is a simple task management system with some surprisingly powerful features.  This is a recent re-entry into my work-flow.  I like the ability to create different lists, whether it's a grocery list, or keeping track of follow-up calls/estimates/quotes that I need to send out for work.  They make the data entry as painless as possible and then you can setup things like iCal feeds to have tasks show up on your calendar.  There is also a pretty decent iPhone app available to Pro customers that let you take your to-do list with you to keep up with things.  I also have used this in a previous position and the ability to let team members send you tasks via email that are then added to your to-do list can be nice to have if working with multiple folks.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4682" title="campfire_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> is an online chat room for teams to collaborate and keep up with each other.  Admittedly, this one is a bit of a stretch for a small at-home business but we all need to collaborate with others on projects from time to time and if you're working from home, this might be the perfect solution.  For free, Campfire offers you a chat room with up to 4 simultaneous chatters and up to 10MB of space for uploaded files.  It can be a quick way to chat with multiple folks about a project and share images.  It could even serve as the virtual water cooler if you're working with other folks in different geographic areas or if you just want to invite some friends into it to fight off the lack of social interaction from working at home :)</p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4683" title="fluid_icon2" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://cotweet.com/">CoTweet</a> -- This one is definitely more team focused.  If you have several folks on your team and you're interacting with Twitter then I would consider this to be a must-have for your team.  It allows you to receive email alerts when someone sends a @reply to your twitter account and allows you all to be logged into the same Twitter account at once and see conversations your account has had with users before you respond to them.  If someone else on the team has already responded to someone, you wouldn't want to send a second response from the same account, would you? :)</p>

<p>What would be on your list?  I'm always looking for a better mouse trap.</p></div>
