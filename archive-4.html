	<div class="post-content"><p>In the recent past I've started gathering some pretty useful tools / programs to simplify my life and help me streamline my work flows.  I wanted to share some of them in case others might find them interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4609" title="textexpander_iphone" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png" alt="" width="60" height="58" /></a><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> - This is a recent addition to my toolkit and I am finding it nearly endlessly helpful.  From coding snippets to canned email responses, it is speeding up my work.  I work in a helpdesk situation of sorts and this allows me to quickly piece together emails from verbiage that we commonly use.  On the coding side of things it helps me out by allowing me to not remember the .htaccess syntax for increasing PHP's memory limit, or turning on error reporting and display_errors.  Complex code snippets are saved for a program I'll mention in a moment, but I'm finding uses for TextExpander all over the place.  Also helpful is its ability to sync snippets across Dropbox.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4611" title="TextMate_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png" alt="" width="61" height="61" /></a><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - The Missing Editor for Mac OS X.  That's a fairly accurate description in my opinion.  It is a panacea for nearly all your editing needs.  I use it for coding (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, etc) as well as working with SQL files.  It has features such as Subversion integration via Bundles.  Also available -- <a href="http://github.com/Gipetto/wordpress.tmbundle">WordPress Bundle</a>,  Markdown, and much more via bundles.  Having syntax highlighting available for basically any coding language I could open is extremely helpful, and if you can get accustomed to working with plain text files, something like this will work great for you.  Given the amount of WordPress work I do these days, I love having the WordPress bundle available.  Creating things like Widgets are basically a 5 minute operation for a simple widget now.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4612" title="evernote_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></a><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> - Great tool for working with notes, remembering things, and having easy access across devices (I have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Mac Mini).  This is an easy solution for keeping my notes available to me no matter what device I have handy.  It seems to fit the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS Principle</a>".  Need to make a to-do list?  No problem, create a bulleted list and add a checkbox at the beginning of each line so you can easily track what has been done and what needs doing.  But I can also keep pictures available there if needed, along with notes about them.  It also lets me break my notes up into notebooks so I can more easily separate my work items from my personal items.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4614" title="dropbox_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png" alt="" width="59" height="59" /></a><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - This is a fantastic, yet simple little utility I've grown to love over the past couple of months.  More often, I am switching between my laptop and desktop computers.  Since I typically store many things I might need on my dropbox, I can easily keep working on whatever is at hand.  I have also been using it to share items with friends and coworkers.  I get asked why I used Dropbox from time to time by folks in an effort, I believe, for me to convince them why they should use it.  I usually don't bite on this though.  I think some folks have a use for it (such as folks that have several devices/computers and want an easy way to have files available to all of them) and some folks don't.</p>

<p><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4615" title="1PasswordLogo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg" alt="" width="57" height="57" /></a><a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> - If you haven't come across this one yet, you should definitely go check it out and try it.  I have so many passwords these days, it's nearly impossible to keep up with them.  However with 1Password I'm able to use a simple hotkey when sitting at a log in form and it instantly enters the correct username and password for me and submits the form.  It even includes some anti-phishing protection to help prevent you from entering your username and password on a site pretending to be one of your common sites.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many other tools I enjoy using, but these 5 have quickly integrated themselves into how I work and I think if I lost any of them I would be quickly looking for some form of replacement.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Last year I started a <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">series of Year End Review posts</a>.  I figured it would be good to continue it this year as so much has happened in my life in 2009, that it's likely not many people know where or what I'm doing any longer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the year started off poorly.  Early in the year, as the economy tanked, I came really close to losing my job.  The guys I was working for fought long and hard though and were able to keep pulling in enough business to allow me to stay on which I greatly appreciated.  Around this same time, I thought it might be good to start cultivating other opportunities if I needed them.  I took a look at the things I was doing and what I really enjoyed, and thought about how to start making that be able to support me.</p>

<p>Early in the year, I announced that I would be organizing <a href="http://wordcamprichmond.org/">WordCamp Richmond</a>.  It is an all day event where folks get together and discuss all things related to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, the powerful blogging and Content Management System for websites.  It also helped me to get my name out there in the local area to let folks know that I was around and could help them work with this tool.  Anyhow, the event came and went, and was a great success.  We had more attendee's then I thought we would, the speakers all performed amazingly, and we're already planning another again in 2010.</p>

<p>Not too long after WordCamp I purchased a new-to-me car, a 2006 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157619443567630/">Subaru Outback</a>, LL Bean.  It's been doing great and really helped out with all the snow we got a week or two back.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157611702737938/">Atticus</a> enjoys riding around in the back and it's an extremely comfortable car to ride around in.</p>

<p>Let's not forget that I also met and started dating Carrie this year :)  We get along great and have spent a lot of time together the past couple of weeks.  Atticus approves of her, so you know she's good stuff.  She attended WordCamp and at some point after it we started talking, and then talking some more, and eventually I worked up the nerve to ask her out and she said yes.  Things have been great ever since.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Summer, I switched jobs to become a contractor at Capital One.  This was my second time back and I enjoyed it, however my stay was brief.  In November, I began speaking with a friend in Denver, CO about a new opportunity.  The new opportunity involves me managing and staffing a <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/">help center for WordPress</a>.  Individuals can call or email us, and receive professional support for their sites/themes/plugins at reasonable prices.  I started work on December 7th and so far things are going great.</p>

<p>So it has been a bumpy year, switching jobs, meeting new folks, starting my business, and many other things.  Even though is seems the year flew by, I'm not sure I can say it was because I was having so much fun.  I'm just hoping that some of what I accomplished this year is going to let me have more fun in the coming years.</p></div>

<p>So WordCamp RVA was today and I was really pleased with how well it turned out.  There were periods today where I was nervous about my presentation, then other periods where I figured it would be fine.  There were times (in the morning) where I was worried if eveything would work out well and whether or not enough people were coming, but in the end I think it turned out great.  Folks seemed to be happy with the content and attendance was just about perfect I think.</p>

<p>It really blew me away that we had folks traveling up from Georgia for the event.  I mean ... wow.  Guys, if you read this blog, let's get a WordCamp Atlanta going on.  I'll help.  There's no reason Georgia shouldn't be able to support it's own WordCamp.</p>

<p>As I said at the event, and have mentioned on twitter, etc, I'm really hoping to organize some follow up events to the main WordCamp Richmond (/RVA) event.  I'd like to focus them on real in depth topics like theme development where we actually take some time and build a theme from scratch.  I'd also like to do the same with plugins.  Plugin development was something I was reluctant to cut from my presentation, but I knew there just wasn't going to be time for it, and it's also a topic that would be really hard to present without giving so many code examples that a lot of the crowd would have been put to sleep.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I would like to give a huge thanks, once again, to <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/">Andrew Miller</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/gatewood5000">Chris Gatewood</a>, and <a href="http://businessbullpen.com/">Business Bullpen</a> along with all the other that helped make today happen.  I may have been in the middle of it all, but they made it easy on me and I really can't thank them all enough.</p></div>

	<div class="post-meta">
		Posted <a href="/2009/03/03/webhosting-advice.html
">March 3rd, 2009</a>
		 in <a href="/category/articles-0.html">Articles</a>	</div>
	<div class="post-content"><p>Webhosting is something I am frequently asked about.  I've had a site hosted in some fashion since the late 90's, so dealing with the in's and out's of hosting is something I've become quite familiar with.  These days I've even moved towards configuring my own servers to host my sites.  But this article isn't going to get into that side of things.</p>

<p>I decided it was time that I finally chronicle what I've learned over the years and what my current setup is along with the reasons I like it how it is.  To the average user, my setup might seem complex, but even if you only put a couple of these practices to work, I think you'll find yourself well on the way to having a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>I practice a fairly modular setup for my array of websites and it has its benefits.  By splitting things up I can get the most bang for the buck by putting critical systems on providers that provide mission critical support, and other things on more inexpensive solutions (yes, even in hosting you largely get what you pay for).</p>

<p>Moving on to my recommended setup:</p>

<p><strong>Registering your domain</strong>
This is the first step in setting up a website for yourself.  I highly recommend <a href="http://enom.com/">eNom.com</a> as a registrar.  I've been using them for nearly 5 years now and they're a pretty solid registrar.  Even if you have already registered your domain somewhere else, I'd recommend considering a transfer of your domain to eNom.</p>

<p>The main reason I like eNom as a registrar is the free DNS hosting, which is crucial to my setup.  However, in general they're a good registrar.  Their prices are competitive, managing your domain is easy with their web interface, and they aren't always trying to push additional services on you.  Don't get me wrong, additional services are there but they don't shove them on you.</p>

<p>Allowing them to host my DNS is the linchpin of my setup.  Many webhosts ask you to set the DNS servers for your domain to theirs.  Unfortunately changing nameservers is still a drawn out process, sometimes taking up to 24-48 hours to complete.  Compounding the issue, many times you can't setup the DNS records on your new nameservers until the domain servers have changed.  This can mean even more hours, potentially of downtime, for your site.  Since my DNS is with eNom, if I change webhosts or email providers, I can just update the zonefile for my domain and usually within an hour or two everything has changed over.</p>

<p>If you REALLY like your current registrar, then you can look into other third party DNS hosting services that will still allow you the benefits I'll be describing below.  I just happen to prefer eNom.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing an email provider</strong>
Many folks will choose to host their email with their current webhost.  That's fine, but I'd argue there are other solutions, better solutions, available to you.  The one I use is GMail.  Google's interface for GMail is pretty top notch and the fact that you can get <a href="http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new">Google Apps</a> for your domain for free, why not choose them?  Their downtime is extremely low, and you can use the web interface when you're not around your computer.  If you do like the feel of a desktop client though, you can still access your email via IMAP or POP3.</p>

<p>Google Apps is also a scalable solution.  You can start off on the free version and add up to 50 users on your domain.  If you outgrow 50 users, or you start running into storage concerns with your archived email you can always convert to the paid version at $50 per year per user.  That's really not that bad of an option unless you have a spare exchange server sitting around (but really, if you have that kind of infrastructure already in place why aren't you just hosting your own website?).</p>

<p>Also, by sourcing your email to a third party like this you also ease transitioning between webhosts should you ever need to.  Since your DNS is hosted by a central party, you never have to change your MX records (the DNS settings that tell your email where to go) when you change your website from one host to another.  This means no concerns over some email getting left on your old host, or losing emails in the transition, etc.</p>

<p>See how hosting your DNS on your own is starting to fit together in the plan?</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a webhost</strong>
This is probably where 90% of my friends that have problems make their mistake.  Webhosting is a low margin business.  They make their money by hosting as many people on as few servers as possible.  The sheer number of competitors in the industry make it almost problematic.  You have everyone from high school (maybe even middle school these days) kids that buy a reseller account with a webhost and then offer plans at $1.99/mo, promising 99.999% uptime and unlimited disk space/bandwidth.  Then on the other end of the spectrum, there are folks offering webhosting for $50/mo and you don't necessarily get $50 of service per month.</p>

<p>Let me be clear, you do not want to host with someone promising unlimited services and extremely high uptime guarantees.  If they're an industry giant, like Yahoo perhaps, you will probably be fine but there will usually be catches involved in the plan.  There are a couple things you should be aware of though between the those two possible scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Scenario 1 - The fly by nighter</em>
In this case, you're definitely in trouble.  They'll soon get bored, or start wondering why they aren't making any money and chances are they'll just shut the server down, leaving you without access to your website (possibly email), etc.  It could take you days to recover.  The whole time your website is down.  Don't even get me started on how these folks tend to like advertising 99.999% uptime.  They often have trouble achieving 80% uptime.</p>

<p><em>Scenario 2 - The industry giant</em>
You're in a slightly better situation here, but keep in mind these companies are in it to make money.  Usually the small print of those agreements you're making during sign up include text saying that if you start to use too much disk space, bandwidth, or processor time, they have the right to shut your site down.  They'll put up all kinds of walls to keep you from actually storing terabytes of data on their servers.  They can't make money on you if they do allow it.  If you plan on using reasonable resources though, you're probably fine, but an industry giant selling unlimited disk space, etc, likely isn't going to do that for $1.99/mo.</p>

<p>So if your website is even the least bit important to you, I recommend you plan on spending around $10-$20 per month on your hosting.  You can find some rock solid providers in that price range and it's really not that expensive.</p>

<p>As for my personal hosting plans, I currently have plans with two separate providers, but that's not something the average user is going to need.</p>

<p>My primary hosting plan is a (dv) server with <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a>.  It hosts mattwalters.net and <a href="http://snipit.me/">SnipIt.me</a> along with some other small sites I have setup mainly for testing purposes.</p>

<p>My other hosting plan is with <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">slicehost</a>.  This plan is where <a href="http://WordPressEasily.com/">WordPressEasily.com</a> and its hosted blogs reside.  WordPress Easily is quite the complicated setup though.  The nature of the service dictates needing to be able to bring new servers online quickly or swap out servers, etc.</p>

<p>Just to finish tying in the modular concept, by having all 3 of these services sourced to different providers, it leaves me in an agile position.  If I need to move to a different webhost for some reason, I can easily change the DNS records for my domain and have my site moved over quickly.  Or if I need to point a subdomain to a different server for whatever reason, it's a quick change.  Same goes for email, if I wanted to change to a different provider, I could do so without affecting my websites.  Really, the only catch to this setup is I can't easily change registrars ;)</p>

<p>Hope you've found this informative and maybe even taken away something good from it.  If you have any tips you'd like to share, by all means feel free to do so in the comments :)</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Well, it's been awhile since I've appeared in a newspaper ;)  Last time, I found myself on the front page of the Richmond Times Dispatch for an article about blogging.  Unfortunately I don't still have a copy of the article on my computer, only a hard copy.  Anyhow, this time is not nearly as splashy, but still cool all the same.  A couple weeks back a reporter for the Wall Street Journal contacted me in reference to this article I wrote about <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2009/01/16/on-being-green/">being green</a>.  Here's the part he quoted me on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new TVs are finding favor with some consumers. After getting a $186 
  electric bill in early December, Matt Walters, a Web developer in 
  Richmond, Va., decided to look for ways to reduce his electricity use. 
  He quickly targeted his 50-inch plasma TV, which has a digital video r
  ecorder, Blu-ray player and other devices connected to it.</p>
  
  <p>"I started looking for devices that were more guilty than others," says 
  Mr. Walters, 29. "The plasma TV was one of the first things" he identified.</p>
  
  <p>Mr. Walters bought a few power strips to connect the TV and other devices 
  together and got in the habit of turning it off when he wasn't using it. 
  When his electric bill arrived the next month, he says to his surprise he 
  saved $27. He plans to pay more attention to the power use of the electronics 
  he buys, and adds that he would consider an energy-efficient TV for his 
  next purchase.</p>
