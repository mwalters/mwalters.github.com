					<h1 class="post-title">On Being Green</h1>
					<div class="post-meta">
						Posted <a href="/2009/01/16/on-being-green.html
">January 16th, 2009</a>
						 in <a href="/category/articles-0.html">Articles</a>					</div>
					<div class="post-content"><p>Last month I was a bit startled to receive an electricity bill that was a little over double what it had been.  Obviously the key factor at play here was the dip in temperatures.  But it still seemed wild that it more then doubled to me.  I decided to do a bit of an experiment to see if I could a) keep it from rising again since it was getting colder, and b) potentially reduce the amount.</p>

<p><strong>Changes I Made</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I took note of my thermostat.  I had talked to the power company and they gave me a basic statistic that for every degree over 68 degree's that you set your thermostat during this time of year, your heater has to work 3 percent harder to keep up.  I have nothing other then them telling me this to back it up, but even if the percentage is off, the concept is logical.  I had my thermostat set to roughly 69/70 degree's.  I reduced it to more in the 66/67 degree range (it's not digital, so I can only be so precise).</p>

<p>I took stock of all my "phantom power" devices.  I had heard that CRT TV's for instance can use almost as much power in the OFF position as they do when they are turned on, and that Plasma TV's weren't much better.  I have a 50" plasma TV and a 30'ish inch CRT TV.  At my Plasma TV I also have a sound system, DVD/Bluray Player, AppleTV, Wii, Cable Box/DVR, and a media center MacBook.  At my CRT TV I have a cable box, DVD player and the TV itself.  Then there's my home office / workstation which has my power adapter for my primary MacBook, speakers, 21'ish inch LCD monitor, powered USB hub, printer, etc.</p>

<p>That is a LOT of devices to try to unplug to reduce phantom power drain.  So I went to Target and purchased several inexpensive power strips.  My workstation uses two of them due to the sheer number of devices.  My Plasma TV area uses one, and my CRT TV uses one.  I wanted to have as little impact on my daily life while still reducing my energy consumption.  So since my HD DVR is at the Plasma area, I put everything except the DVR onto the power strip.  This way the DVR can still record programs even though all the other devices are completely turned off when I flip the power strip.</p>

<p>The other change I made, and this is the part that takes a little discipline is I started forcing myself to turn the power strips off when I wasn't going to be actively using one of the areas.  So if I'm not in my living room watching the Plasma, it's power strip is off.  Same with the other two stations.  When I go to bed, I turn on the power strip for the CRT, watch TV and eventually fall asleep, then before I leave my bedroom in the morning, I make sure to flip it off.  It isn't hard, and it's completely become habit now.</p>

<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>

<p>Well, I didn't really know what to expect.  Also, since you don't receive a power bill until you're already partially into your next billing cycle, I haven't been able to test this concept for a full month.  However, the temperatures have been dropping in general still.  But so far the end result is my electric bill went down a little over $25.  I think that is worthwhile personally.  I'll definitely be interested in seeing what the next bill tells me.</p>

<p><strong>Of Note</strong></p>

<p>I got this concept from a DIY TV Show once that was focused on being Eco Friendly.  There is a product out there called a <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/green-switch-for-green-savings">Green Switch</a>.  Basically by changing some of your wiring a little, you can use this one switch to power down various devices across your entire house.  I lease a town house so a modification like this doesn't work in my scenario.  However, I was able to accomplish almost the same thing with my use of inexpensive power strips.  I thought it was worth mentioning here for any homeowners that might be interested in the Green Switch however.</p>
