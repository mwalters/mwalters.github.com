	<div class="post-content"><p>Over the past weeks/months I've become more interested in making sure my systems are properly backed up.  Recently <a href="/2008/12/13/home-work-space/?phpMyAdmin=544c4b4bff4ct2249f7e0#comment-100173">I mentioned</a> I wanted to detail my setup in a post.  It's been awhile since I've suffered a significant hardware failure (knock on wood) so part of me thinks I'm "due" for one.  Here is my basic process and my current setup:</p>

<p>Setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>2008 MacBook (Main System) - 320GB internal drive</li>
<li>First Gen black MacBook (Media Center / File Server) 80GB internal drive</li>
<li>3x250GB external HDD</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220246">2GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220247">4GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220301">8GB</a> thumb drives (these particular ones are <em>tiny</em>)</li>
<li>Account with <a href="http://www.bingodisk.com/">BingoDisk</a> (100GB Plan)</li>
<li>Amazon S3 Account</li>
<li>MobileMe Account</li>
</ul>

<p>Process:
<ol>
* My main system has a TimeMachine (250GB external USB) drive connected to it almost constantly.  It's certainly connected when I'm working, and is usually only not connected when I retire to the sofa to watch TV or go to a friends house and am just goofing off on it.  I travel with the external drive.
* Periodically (I try to do this at least once per week) I use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> to clone my main system to a second drive (250GB external USB) which is also carried with me when I travel.
* Less periodically then in Step 2 I do a SuperDuper! clone to the third drive (250GB external USB).  This so that if my typical HDD clone is for some reason bad, I can step further back in time in hopes that it will be ok.  This drive does not travel with me.
* OSX Install Disk has been cloned to a 8GB thumb drive and travels with me.
* I haven't received it yet, but I ordered <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">Disk Warrior 4</a> which I also plan to clone to a thumb drive, and it will travel with me.
* My main system has a copy of the music from my iTunes library and some random videos.  I typically purchase new content on my main system and download to it.  Weekly I perform an rsync backup of my iTunes library from my main system to my first gen MacBook iTunes library.
* My first gen MacBook weekly (or whenever I add a substantial amount of content to it) performs an rsync of its iTunes library to Bingodisk.  Its iTunes library has my full collection -- music, TV shows, movies, etc.
* S3 is used sparsely.  I know it's supposed to be supremely reliable, but I have lots of issues with it timing out when copying large amounts of data to it.
* MobileMe account is used to store things like online receipts and various documents I like to keep handy.
</ol>
All things considered, I view this as a fairly comprehensive backup strategy, and it is fairly easy to maintain.  For instance, to rsync from my main system to my first gen MacBook, I quickly mount the volume on my main system and then run this shell script:
<pre>rsync -a -u -v -F --exclude="<em>DS_Store</em>" /Users/username/music/itunes/"iTunes Music"/ /Volumes/Media/iTunes/</pre>
Then the script is very similar to rsync from my first gen MacBook to Bingodisk.  It also keeps it from transferring annoying DS_Store files on Mac systems.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/Products/drobo.html">Drobo system</a> in the near future to connect to my first gen MacBook and use it for most of my file serving needs and further simplify my backup process.</p>

<p>Anyone see something I'm missing or have any further tips to give me a better safety net?</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>So for those that don't <em>really</em> know me, I tend to be a bit of an introvert (ok, ok, for those that <em>really</em> know me, a lot of an introvert), and can have some pretty geeky tendencies at times.  But I think the subject matter of this post could be useful to both introverts and extroverts, geeks and non-geeks.</p>

<p>It all centers around this basic question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about an experience you've had that excited you.  What 
  were some of the obstacles you encountered during that experience, 
  and how did you overcome them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before taking my new position, I was the Web Development Manager for an advertising agency.  One of my responsibilities was interviewing potential developers to get a feel for their skills, and how well they would fit in with the current team.</p>

<p>I think a lot of geeks totally miss that second part.  To them (and me until I had a realization of my own), my social skills shouldn't really matter.  After all, what should really matter is how well I can do the tasks I'll be assigned, and as a coder (from a geeks perspective), my social skills shouldn't really be a variable in the equation.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), that's not the case.  You need to be able to get along with your potential teammates and not cause turmoil in the process.  Your manager doesn't want to have to deal with that, and doesn't want to risk upsetting the team balance.</p>

<p>Now, back to The question.  Many times other managers or co-workers asked me what types of questions I asked.  I also worked with recruiters, and they'd often ask what type of questions I'd be giving their applicants.  Both groups of people often laughed at my answer.</p>

<p>Here's the deal, I've interviewed a decent number of people, and I only ever had The question prepared.  I'd phrase it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.  
  What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while 
  building the project, and how did you overcome them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The great thing about this question is that it starts a true conversation.  Based on how the applicant answered, I almost immediately knew whether I was interested in hiring them or not.  Let's look at why the question is successful.  The question has 3 basic parts.</p>

<p><strong>1) Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.</strong></p>

<p>What I really want is to see the candidate get excited.  This part of the question gives them every reason and every chance to do so.  I wanted to see that "burning desire" for what they do for a living to come out and show itself.</p>

<p><strong>2) What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while building the project?</strong></p>

<p>This is potentially a nicer way to ask, "what are some of your weaknesses."  However it is a little open ended in that regard.  The difficulties they encountered might not be due to a weakness at all, but just a problem that was genuinely difficult to solve.  Either way, the answer they give you is worthy of hearing.  It also potentially gives you the opportunity to discuss some of your personal experience, and how your team operates.</p>

<p><strong>3) How did you overcome them?</strong></p>

<p>This is the real meat and potatoes of most interviews anyhow.  Remember in math class how your teacher would some times give you partial credit if you showed your work but made a mistake somewhere along the way?  I think this question is somewhat like that.  I wanted to see how you thought through problems, how your brain works.  Whether I would have solved it the same way does not matter at all.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think the managers, coworkers, recruiters chuckled at me because all they really heard me say was, "I only come prepared with one question to an interview."  I would say back to them, "but look at the question I ask."  Usually once they'd thought it over, it made a lot more sense to them.  Some were always skeptical though.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though, I had some real varied responses to the question in interviews.  Everything from "well, I guess my personal site because it has some flash and that was tough" to 30-45 minute responses that resembled dissertations almost.  The latter was closer to what I was looking for.  The former shows absolutely no burning desire for the work, and little regard for my time to be quite honest.  But again, I'd argue that's one of the best things about The question.  If they give me the short quip, I know almost instantly that they're not a person I'm interested in hiring.  The ones that engage me in conversation, I'll know enough about to make an informed decision on whether they have the technical aptitude to fulfill the positions requirements and whether they'll fit in socially with the team.  That's the whole point of an interview, isn't it?</p>

<p>Even when I'm interviewing for positions, I try to give myself the opportunity to answer this question.  It's pretty easy to work in.  Just wait for the interviewer to ask you a fairly open-ended question (which they pretty much always do), and then answer them by answering this question.  It has a couple benefits for you as well.  You get to show them excitement, you get to show off something cool you did instead of just listing technical skills (boring!).  It also gives you a chance to engage them in a conversation, instead of worrying about what question is coming next.  It takes away some of that innate nervousness that comes with being interviewed.  That's a major plus if you're an introvert like me.</p></div>

	<div class="post-content"><p>Jim decided <a href="http://cvreg.org/2007/6/6/my-language-is-better-then-yours-php-edition">to respond</a> to my post regarding <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/05/22/my-language-is-better-then-yours/">language vs. language debates</a>, specifically looking at PHP and Ruby / Ruby on Rails. He makes some good points, but there is some stuff that I'd like to respond to and clarify...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say that one language is better than the other is meaningless. Better 
  in what way? The question should always be asked in a particular context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely agree, in general, I'm just tired of language vs. language debates ... more on that in a moment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t want to talk about the ads, though, because they have 
  their own agenda and it certainly doesn’t match mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Works for me, but keep in mind that most of my original post was working towards making the point that the video's were doing an apples to oranges comparison of PHP (minus framework) to Ruby on Rails.  Jeremy and I disagreed on the validity of this comparison.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, that’s why I am using open-source tools in the first place 
  ...
  For me, the bulk of my language preference comes from language philosophy.
  ...
  but for my tastes, I appreciate the additional power that Ruby 
  metaprogramming allows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some key points that I can agree with, but again, more on that in a moment...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHP =~ COBOL is not an analogy I would make, but at the same time I’d 
  urge you to consider your claim “You’ll always be taking over a Java 
  project or a .NET project or a PHP in light of COBOL, or FORTRAN, or 
  VAX or any other platform that’s been a dominant success in the past. 
  Current popularity is no guarantee of future popularity. In our 
  industry, better mousetraps are ruthlessly adopted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree, as I even said, I can see PHP going by the wayside one day, but today is not that day, and I still believe it's extremely premature to be concerning myself with but so much.  It seemed Jeremy was arguing that Ruby on Rails projects are more easily taken over,  so my counterpoint was simply that RoR, like any other language, is not likely to be so widely adopted that his point would ever really become something you could rely on.  Just to be sure I'm clear, I'm saying that it is unlikely that RoR will become so widespread that you can count on commonly taking over other RoR projects.  This is not me slamming RoR, the same statement could be made in the direction of PHP, .NET, etc.  You'll always be taking over projects built on other platforms.  Even as a PHP developer I experience this commonly.  Just the other day I had to take over a .NET project and we chose to redo it in PHP for various reasons.  I hope that's clear, and if it's not I wish someone would ask the questions I need to answer to make it clear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your focus, like in your last paragraph, is only on user experience 
  (by which I think you mean developer experience), then language preference 
  may truly not matter. But if your focus as a developer is on avoiding 
  future “forced” language changes, then it might make more sense to attempt 
  to determine which new technologies might eventually usurp the old. My 
  claim is that Ruby and Rails are better positioned to do so that PHP
  and its framework set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, finally to the point I kept putting off above.  I actually was not speaking of developer experience.  I was speaking of end-user experience, the folks that visit our websites.  THEIR experience is what matters in the end.  PHP, RoR, .NET, etc are all capable of providing similar, if not identical user experiences.  So if I prefer to provide that user experience with PHP, using mainly procedural based programming, then why not?  If you want to do so with RoR, or any other platform, then more power to you.  As you indicated, there are things about RoR that make you prefer it over PHP.  I see no problem with that.  But to say those ways are better then mine, if achieving a particular user experience is the ultimate measure, is sort of pointless, unless you disagree that the languages are capable of producing similar/identical experiences.</p>

<p>I also want to comment on the fact that it seems in these conversations I keep getting pegged as being resistant to change, not eager to learn new languages, etc.  To be blunt, it's pissing me off.  I've lost count of the languages that at some point I've been well-versed in, let alone the languages I've "dabbled" in.  Just because I'm not actively learning RoR at the moment, does not mean that I think PHP is Gods gift to programming nor does it mean that I am resistant to new languages as a whole.  PHP has its flaws.  One day it will be replaced (just like .NET, RoR, and even Java) but I don't think that day is tomorrow or the day after, so I don't feel pressure to move on yet.  I think RoR is doing some great things for the development community as a whole.  Some things I see in RoR, I adopt in PHP.  That kind of thing is good for all of us.  But <strong>again</strong>, just because I don't choose to use RoR, doesn't mean that if something else came along I wouldn't take the time to consider how it might could benefit me.  At some point I'm sure I'll re-assess RoR, and who knows, maybe I'll dive in.  Right now, it just doesn't make sense for me to.</p></div>
